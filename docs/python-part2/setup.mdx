    <summary>**Prerequisites - Before You Dive In!**</summary>

Let's make sure we're all set with these fun and essential skills:

[**Environment Exploration**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful editor that supports code editing, debugging, and task running. It's a local app that you need to install on your computer. We'll be using VS Code as our Python environment.

[**Turtle Documentation**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html): It's time to put your thinking cap on! Learn the basics of Turtle graphics and discover how to create and shape intricate designs like a true coding artist. Who knew coding with Python Turtle could be so artsy?

So, gear up and get ready to embark on this exciting coding journey. With these skills under your belt, you'll be unstoppable! 🚀💻

## Objective 🧐🗿

Hey there, future Python masters! Are you ready to kickstart our coding adventure? Let's set up our environment and get ready to unleash our creativity!

## Prepare Your Creative Space
Open VS Code and create a new file by selecting File > New File. Save this as a Python file by choosing File > Save As and entering the filename “YourLastName_SpaceInvaders.py”. This setup places your code in the main editor window. 

Think of this blank file as your canvas, just waiting for your creativity to take flight.
