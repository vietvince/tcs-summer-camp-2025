# Stage 1: LawnMowers

## Objective üßêüóø

We are going to help out the players that are not good at video games. To do this, we will add a last line of defense to our game: LawnMowers. Instead of grass they will be cutting
down zombies.

## Step 1 - Set up the Environment üåçüå±

### 1.1 Unity Interface and Camera Movement Recap

First, ensure you are operating in a 2D game environment. Go to **Edit > Project Settings > Editor** and enable **Enter Play Mode Options** for efficient testing.

Familiarize yourself with key areas of the Unity Editor:

- **Scene View**: Build and modify your game space.
- **Game View**: Preview the game as you develop.
- **Inspector**: Adjust settings and properties of selected game elements.

**Navigation Tips**:
- Rotate the scene with the right mouse button.
- Pan using the middle mouse button or holding `Alt` + left mouse button.
- Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.

Adjust the camera to cover the main gameplay area. This setting is crucial as it determines what the player sees.

## Step 2 - Set up the Objects üì¶üîß

### 2.1 Finding a LawnMower

**LawnMower Sprite**:
- Create or find a lawnmower sprite to use for our game. (Or you can use a lambo)
- If you are really good at drawing, bonus points for drawing one yourself. Just make sure the image will have a transparent background!

### 2.2 Create Basic LawnMower Object

**Setup**:
- In Unity, create a new Sprite object in your scene and name it 'LawnMower'.
- It will have a box collider 2D with onTrigger checked. 
- It will always have  Rigidbody 2D with gravity scale equals to 0 and collision detection to continuous. 

**Sprite Renderer**:
- Attach your lawnmower sprite using the Sprite Renderer component to visualize the lawnmower in your game.

**Transforms**:
- Position the lawnmower to fit the scene appropriately. Adjust scale and rotation if necessary.

## Step 3 - Set up the Lawnmower Script üåøüöú

### 3.1 Script Basic Lawnmower Movement

Create a script named `LawnmowerMovement` to define basic behaviors:

```csharp
LawnMower Class:
   Declare variables:
      - isMoving: a boolean to track if the lawnmower is moving.
      - speed: a float to define the speed of the lawnmower.
      - sound: an audio clip for the sound effect.
      - source: a private audio source to play the sound.

   Start method:
      - Add an audio source component to the game object.
      - Assign the added audio source to the private variable source.

   OnTriggerEnter2D method:
      - Check if the collided object's layer is 7.
      - If isMoving is false:
      - Play the sound using the audio source.
      - Call the hit method on the ZombieScript component of the collided object with parameters 100 and false.
      - Set isMoving to true.
      - Schedule the destruction of the game object after 8 seconds.

    Update method:
      - If isMoving is true, then update the position of the game object by adding (speed * Time.deltaTime, 0, 0) to its current position.
```

## Step 4 - Duplicate Lawnmowers üîÅüöú

### 4.1 Create 5 Lawnmowers

Lawnmower Object:
- Create an empty object to store all five (or how ever many) lawnmowers for good organization. 

**Tip:**
If you find the interface unfamiliar or challenging:
- Take extra time to experiment.
- Add various objects, explore different settings, and observe their effects in the Game View. 
- Familiarity now will make advanced lessons more accessible.

    <summary><strong>Medium: Add sounds to the lawnmower.</strong></summary>

**Goal: Add sound effects when the lawnmower triggers.**

    **5.1 Create an audio component**

        After adding the component, assign a sound clip to the component. 

    **5.2 Modify the script**

        Make the sound play when the lawnmower triggers in the lawnmower script.

    <summary><strong>Hard: Make the lawnmower respawn after some time</strong></summary>

**Goal: Create a way for the lawnmovers to respawn after used. **

    **6.1 Add respawn script to lawnmower**

        As a pro gamer, we will have to add a respawn time to our lawnmower script. Hint: Time.
