# Lesson 2: Defensive Plants

## Objective üßêüóø

In this session, we will implement the behavior and management of some defensive plants, particularly Wall-nut. If you already implemented Wall-nut, well time for Tallnut! 


## Step 1 - Creating the Wall-nut Object ü•úüì¶

### 1.1 Creating the Wall-nut 

You should already have a peashooter and the plant script inside the peashooter object (not the one in plant slots) working before this lesson. 

- **Wall-nut sprite**: Find asset sprite transparent images to use in our Unity game. We will be looking for the Wall-nut.
- **Creating our Wall-nut object**: Duplicate our existing peashooter object. It should already and change the sprite and sprite object.
- **Wall-nut Doesn't attack**: The Wall-nut's job is not attacking, so we will be removing the shoot script from it. 

## Step 2 - Designing the Wall-nut ü•úüîß

### 2.1 Tweaking our Wall-nut Values

Organize your game space:

- **Properties assigning**: Give the Wall-nut a good chunk of health!
- **Create the box collider**: Make the hit collider fit with the Wall-nut sprite. 

### 2.2 Final Touches
  Make sure the Wall-nut is able to be planted down and tank a bunch of hits from the zombie. Double check the plant script if Wall-nut doesn't act, well like a Wall-nut.

    <summary><strong>Medium: Add Wall-nut animations</strong></summary>


**Goal: Implement interactive behaviors for the Wall-nut.**

    **2.1 Gather your assets**

    Search online for peashooter assets to animate! Preferably a Wall-nut sheet with a different image for each frame. 

    **2.2 Editing the sheet**

    Use the sprite editor and slice the sheet file, then replace the existing peashooter object's sprite with the peashooter sheet. 

    **2.3 Animate**

    Use the animation editor to create an animation! Simply drag the images onto the editor and click play until the animation looks right.

    <summary><strong>Hard: Add multiple sprite images for the Wall-nut when it is at different health points</strong></summary>

**Goal: Implement a Wall-nut with 3 phases.**

    The Wall-nut should have three different phases base on how much health he have. You will need to make a script inside the Wall-nut object, you got this!
