## Objective 🧐🗿

Welcome to the explosive adventure of Stage 6! Get ready to navigate the treacherous terrain of the Military Minefield. Gear up and brace yourselves for a thrilling journey through hidden dangers and mysterious traps!

## Description 📖🪶

Welcome, brave adventurers, to the heart-pounding challenge of Stage 6 - where mysterious mines lie hidden, waiting to reveal themselves with a bang! Are you ready to test your wits and courage in this perilous terrain?

We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox explode when it gets touched. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

**1. Detect Touch:**

The script will detect when the part is touched. 

**2. Create an Explosion:**

When the part is touched, it will create an explosion at the part's position. 

**3. Change Part Appearance:**

The part will become fully visible when it explodes. 

**By doing this, we will create an exciting effect where the part explodes and becomes visible when touched.** 

## Instructions and Code Logic 📝📚

### Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables

- Create a variable to hold the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

### Step 2 - Create a Function

- Connect a function to the part's `Touched` event to detect when the part is touched. 

- Inside the function, create a new explosion. 

- Set the explosion's parent to `workspace` so it appears in the game. 

- Set the explosion's position to the part's position. 

- Set the explosion's blast radius to 50. 

- Make the part fully visible by setting its `Transparency` to 0. 

## Putting It All Together 🔧🔩

- Start by setting up your part variable. 

- Connect a function to the part's `Touched` event to detect touches. 

- Inside the function, create a new explosion and set its properties. 

- Make the part fully visible when it is touched.

    **Description 📖🪶** 

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox explode when touched and reset its transparency periodically. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    *1. Create an Explosion:*
    
    The part will create an explosion at its position when touched. 

    *2. Reset Transparency:*
    
    The part's transparency will be reset periodically. 

    *By doing this, the part will explode when touched and keep becoming visible again after a short time.* 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic 📝📚**

    Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables 

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    Step 2 - Create a Function

    - Define a function named `Explode`. 

    - Inside the function, create a new explosion. 

    - Set the part's transparency to 0 (fully opaque). 

    - Set the parent of the explosion to `workspace`. 

    - Set the position of the explosion to the part's position. 

    - Set the blast radius of the explosion. 

    - Connect the `Explode` function to the part's `Touched` event to detect when it is touched. 

    Step 3 - Create an Infinite Loop

    - Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, set the part's transparency to 0 (fully opaque). 

    - Wait for a random time between 1 and 4 seconds. 

    - Set the part's transparency to 1 (fully invisible). 

    - Wait for a random time between 1 and 4 seconds. 

    - The loop will automatically start running and resetting the part's transparency. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together 🔧🔩**

    - Start by setting up your part variable. 

    - Define a function named `Explode` to handle creating the explosion. 

    - Connect the `Explode` function to the part's `Touched` event. 

    - Create an infinite loop to keep resetting the part's transparency. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a random time.

    **Description 📖🪶**

    We are going to create a script that spawns multiple instances of "ExplodingSand" within the bounds of a parent part in Roblox. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    *1. Spawn ExplodingSand:*
    
    The script will create a specified number of ExplodingSand parts at random positions within the parent part. 

    *2. Set Positions Randomly:*
    
    The ExplodingSand parts will be placed randomly within the boundaries of the parent part. 

    *By doing this, we will create a dynamic environment with ExplodingSand parts spawning in random positions.* 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic 📝📚**

    Step 1 - Set up the Starting Variables

    - Get the `ServerStorage` service from the game. 

    - Create a variable for the parent part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Create a variable for the ExplodingSand template stored in `ServerStorage`. 

    - Create a variable for the number of ExplodingSand parts to spawn (`sandAmount`). 

    Step 2 - Create a Function

    - Define a function named `spawnExplodingSand`. 

    - Inside the function, get the size and position of the parent part. 

    - Calculate the minimum and maximum X and Z boundaries for spawning within the parent part. 

    - Calculate the Y position for spawning on top of the parent part. 

    - Randomly determine the X and Z positions within the boundaries. 

    - Clone the ExplodingSand template. 

    - Set the parent of the cloned ExplodingSand to `Workspace`. 

    - Set the position of the cloned ExplodingSand to the calculated random position. 

    Step 3 - Create an Infinite Loop

    - Create a loop that runs for the specified number of times (`sandAmount`). 

    - Inside the loop, call the `spawnExplodingSand` function to create each ExplodingSand part. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together 🔧🔩**

    - Start by getting the `ServerStorage` service and setting up the parent part and ExplodingSand template. 

    - Define the number of ExplodingSand parts to spawn. 

    - Create a function named `spawnExplodingSand` to handle the spawning logic. 

    - Inside the function, calculate the random positions and clone the ExplodingSand template. 

    - Use a loop to call the function and spawn the specified number of ExplodingSand parts.
