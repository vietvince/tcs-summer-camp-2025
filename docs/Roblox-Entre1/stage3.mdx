## Objective üßêüóø

Welcome to the heart-pounding third stage of our Obby adventure! Get ready to tackle the daring challenge of creating the Plank Walkway.

## Description üìñü™∂

Hey fearless adventurers! Stage 3 just got a whole lot trickier, but I know you're up for the challenge! Get ready to swap those planks and bring on the chaos ‚Äì but remember, your Code Coach is always here to lend a hand if you need it. Let's dive in and see if you can tackle this challenge all on your own!

We are going to create a script that makes three parts in Roblox swap positions randomly. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

**1. Start with Three Parts:**

We will have three parts in our game. 

**2. Swap Positions**

The parts will switch places with each other randomly. 

**3. Keep Swapping:**

The parts will keep swapping positions continuously, creating a fun effect. 

**By doing this, the parts will keep moving to each other's positions randomly, making the game more interesting.** 

## Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö

### Step 1 - Set Up Starting Variables

- Create variables for each of the three parts (`part1`, `part2`, and `part3`). 

### Step 2 - Create a Function

- Define a function named `swapPositions` that takes two parts (`partA` and `partB`) and swaps their positions. 

### Step 3 - Make an Infinite Loop

- Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

### Step 4 - Choose a Random Swap

- Inside the loop, choose a random number between 1 and 3. 

### Step 5 - Swap Based on Random Choice

- If the random number is 1, swap the positions of `part1` and `part2`. 

- If the random number is 2, swap the positions of `part2` and `part3`. 

- If the random number is 3, swap the positions of `part3` and `part1`. 

### Step 6 - Pause the Loop

- Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time, such as 2 seconds, before repeating the loop. 

## Putting It All Together üîßüî©

- Start by setting up your three parts. 

- Define a function named `swapPositions` that swaps the positions of two parts. 

- Create an infinite loop using `while true do`. 

- Inside the loop, choose a random number between 1 and 3. 

- Swap the positions of the parts based on the random number. 

- Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time. 

- Repeat the loop to keep swapping the parts' positions randomly.

    **Description üìñü™∂** 

    We are going to create a script that swaps the positions of three parts in Roblox and "kills" any player who touches specific parts. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    *1. Swap Positions:*
    
    Randomly swap the positions of three parts. 

    *2. Detect Touch:*
    
    If a player touches specific parts, their health will be set to zero. 

    *By doing this, we will create a dynamic environment where parts move around and affect players who touch them.* 

    <br  />
    
    **Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö**

    Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables

    - Create variables for the parts by getting them from the `Workspace` (`part1`, `part2`, and `part3`). 

    Step 2 - Create a Function to Swap Positions

    - Define a function named `swapPositions` that takes two parts (`partA` and `partB`) as arguments. 

    - Inside the function, swap the positions of the two parts. 

    - Define a function named `onTouchKillBrick` that takes a part (`hit`) as an argument. 

    - Inside the function, get the parent of the touched part (which should be a player's character). 

    - Check if the parent has a `Humanoid` component. 

    - If it does, set the `Humanoid`'s health to zero. 

    - Connect the `onTouchKillBrick` function to the `Touched` event for the red and blue parts (`part2` and `part3`). 

    Step 3 - Create an Infinite Loop

    - Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, generate a random index between 1 and 3. 

    - Use the random index to determine which parts to swap. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time before swapping again. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together üîßüî©**

    - Start by setting up your parts. 

    - Define functions to swap positions and handle player touch. 

    - Connect the touch function to the `Touched` event for the specified parts. 

    - Create an infinite loop to keep swapping positions randomly.

    **Description üìñü™∂** 

    We are going to create a script that makes three parts in Roblox swap positions continuously with smooth tween animations. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    *1. Swap Positions:*
    
    The parts will switch places with each other randomly. 

    *2. Smooth Movement:*
    
    The movement will be smooth using tween animations. 

    *3. Continuous Loop:*
    
    The parts will keep swapping positions continuously. 

    *By doing this, the parts will create a fun and dynamic effect by continuously moving to each other's positions with smooth animations.* 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö **

    Step 1 - Set up the Starting Variables

    - Get the `TweenService` from the game services. 

    - Create variables for three parts in the workspace (`part1`, `part2`, and `part3`). 

    - Create a variable for the duration of the tween in seconds (`tweenTime`). 

    Step 2 - Create a Function to Swap Positions with Tween

    - Define a function named `swapPositionsWithTween` that takes two parts (`partA` and `partB`) as arguments. 

    - Inside the function, store the position of `partA` temporarily. 

    - Create `TweenInfo` to define the tween properties (duration, easing style, and easing direction). 

    - Create a tween to move `partA` to the position of `partB`. 

    - Create a tween to move `partB` to the position of `partA` (stored in `tempPosition`). 

    - Play both tweens. 

    - Wait for the tween for `partA` to complete before proceeding. 

    Step 3 - Create an Infinite Loop to Swap Positions Continuously 

    - Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, generate a random index between 1 and 3. 

    - Based on the random index, swap positions of the parts using the `swapPositionsWithTween` function. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for 2 seconds before the next swap. 

    - The loop will automatically start running and swapping the parts' positions. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together üîßüî©**

    - Start by getting the `TweenService` and setting up the parts and tween duration. 

    - Define a function named `swapPositionsWithTween` to handle the position swapping with tweens. 

    - Create an infinite loop to keep swapping the parts' positions based on a random index. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for 2 seconds between swaps.
