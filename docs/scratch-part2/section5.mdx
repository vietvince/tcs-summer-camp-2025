## Objective 🧐

Use two costumes and Scratch clones to create a seamless, infinite scrolling level.

## Getting Started with Scratch 🚩

### Step 1. Separate the Code Blocks

1. Select your **when green flag clicked** into 2 separate blocks and add some additions:
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    go to x: (0) y: (0)
    create clone of [myself v]
```
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    forever
        change x by (-10)
        if [(x position) < (-480)] then
            change x by (960)
        end
    end
```

### Step 3. Adding Clones

1. Rename the Backdrop to "level1.1"

2. Duplicate "level1.1" and rename it to "level1.2"

3. In the **Scripts** area, under edit this code:
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    go to x: (0) y: (0)
    create clone of [myself v]
```
to

```scratch
when green flag clicked
    hide
    go to x: (0) y: (0)
    switch costume to [level1.1 v]
    create clone of (myself)
    next costume
    change x by (480)
    create clone of (myself)
```
This hides the original sprite and spawns two clones:

- Clone 1 uses costume 1.1 at x = 0

- Clone 2 uses costume 1.2 at x = 480

### Step 4. Test Your Infinite Scroll

1. Click the green flag.

2. Observe a continuous, seamless scrolling floor composed of both costumes.

- [x] **Awesome!** You now have an infinite scrolling level using just two costumes and clones. Next up: **Geometry Dash 6 – Adding Spikes & Collision Detection**.
