## Objective üßê

Design and position your level‚Äôs backdrop and floor sprites to set the stage for scrolling gameplay.

## Getting Started with Scratch üö©

### Step 1. Paint the Background

1. Click the **Stage** thumbnail and switch to the **Backdrops** tab.  
2. Click **Paint** to create a new backdrop.  
3. Use the **Rectangle** tool to draw a full-stage purple rectangle (no border) as the wallpaper.  
4. Choose a vivid purple fill and ensure it covers the entire canvas, overlapping edges slightly to avoid seams.

Backdrops are static‚Äîthey stay fixed behind all sprites. We‚Äôll scroll the level sprites instead of the backdrop.

### Step 2. Create the Floor Sprite

1. Click **Choose a Sprite** ‚Üí **Paint**.  
2. In the Costume Editor, use the **Rectangle** tool (border width = 0) to draw a wide, vivid purple band across the bottom of the canvas.  
3. Position it low enough so there‚Äôs ample space above for gameplay.  

### Step 3. Decorate the Level

(Optional) Add extra rectangles by holding Alt then dragging to duplicate shapes, and Shift to keep alignments.

Draw a white line across the top of your floor with the Line tool (border width = 4, hold Shift for straight lines).

Nudge shapes using arrow keys for pixel-perfect placement.

### Step 4. Save Your Progress

Click File ‚Üí Save now to lock in your level design.
