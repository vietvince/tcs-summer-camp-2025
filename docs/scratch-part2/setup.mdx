    <summary>**Prerequisites – Before You Dive In!**</summary>

    Hey there, future game developers! Before we launch into building our Space Shooter, make sure you’ve got these essentials locked in:

    - [**Scratch Account**](https://scratch.mit.edu): Scratch is a free, online coding platform. No downloads required—just snap blocks together to build games and animations.  
    - [**Scratch Documentation**](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Wiki_Home): Learn about sprites, backdrops, scripts, and how the Scratch editor is organized.  

    With these ready, you’re all set for lift-off! 🚀
