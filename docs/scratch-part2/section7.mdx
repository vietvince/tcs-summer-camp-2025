## Objective üßê

Introduce a `scrollSpeed` variable to control level movement and create a smooth deceleration effect when the player collides with a spike.

## Getting Started with Scratch üö©

### Step 1. Create the `scrollSpeed` Variable

1. In the **Variables** category, click **Make a Variable**.  
2. Name it `scrollSpeed` and click **OK**.

### Step 2. Initialize `scrollSpeed`

1. In your Player sprite's script, edit this code:
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    wait until <touching color [#FFFFE0]>
    stop [all v]
```

to: 

```scratch
when green flag clicked
    go to x: (**PUT YOUR PLAYER'S X**) y: (**PUT YOUR PLAYER'S Y**)
    set [scrollSpeed v] to (-10)
    wait until <touching color [#FFFFE0]>
    stop [all v]
```

In your clone scrolling script, replace:

```
change x by (-10)
```

with:

```
change x by (scrollSpeed)
```

### Step 3. Update Clone Scrolling Behavior

Make sure your clones use the scrollSpeed variable:

```
when I start as a clone
  show
  forever
    change x by (scrollSpeed)
    if <(x position) < (-480)> then
      change x by (960)
    end
  end
```

### Step 4. Smooth Deceleration on Collision

In the player sprite‚Äôs collision script, locate:

```
stop [all v]
```

Replace it with:

```
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
repeat (10)
    change [scrollSpeed v] by (1)
    change x by (scrollSpeed)
end
```

- This will gradually change scrollSpeed from ‚Äì10 up to 0 over 10 frames, easing the level to a halt.

- [x] **Excellent!** Your level now slows down smoothly on game over instead of disappearing abruptly. Next up: **Geometry Dash 8 ‚Äì Collision Sound Effect**.
