  <summary>**Prerequisites: Before You Dive In!**</summary>

- You have completed **Geometry Dash 1‚Äì5** (Drawing the Player, Adding Music & Jumping, Level Design, Scrolling the Level, Infinite Scroll with Clones).  
- You‚Äôre familiar with the Scratch editor: Sprites pane, Costume Editor, and basic scripting blocks like **when green flag clicked**, **forever**, and **stop [all]**.

## Objective üßê

Create spike obstacles in your level and detect collisions so the game ends when the player hits a spike.

## Getting Started with Scratch üö©

### Step 1. Design the Spike Sprite

1. Click **Choose a Sprite** ‚Üí **Paint**.  
2. In the Costume Editor, select the **Rectangle** tool, hold **Shift** and draw a black square.  
3. Switch to the **Select** tool, click one corner and press **Delete** to form a right-angled triangle.  
4. With the **Select** tool, rotate the triangle while holding **Shift** so it sits at a 45¬∞ angle (pointing up).  
5. Set the **Border** color to white, width **4 px** (or pale yellow outline to ease color-based collision detection).  
6. Rename this sprite to **Spike**.

  Using a unique outline color (like a very pale yellow) helps Scratch‚Äôs **touching color** block detect collisions more reliably.

### Step 2. Position Your Spike

1. In your **Spike** sprite‚Äôs **Scripts** area, add:
```scratch
   when green flag clicked
     show
     go to x: (100) y: (-50)
```

- Adjust x and y values so the spike rests on the floor at your desired location.

### Step 3. Detect Collision in the Player Sprite

Select the Player sprite.

In the Scripts area, add:

```scratch
when green flag clicked
  wait until <touching color [#FFFFE0]>
  stop [all v]
```

- Replace #FFFFE0 with the exact outline color of your spike (use the color-picker).

- Click the green flag and run into a spike‚Äîeverything should stop on contact!

### Step 4. Save Your Progress

Click File ‚Üí Save now to lock in your spike and collision setup.
