## Objective üßê

Bring your Geometry Dash square to life with a looping soundtrack and smooth jumping mechanics.

## Getting Started with Scratch üö©

### Step 1. Add & Loop Music

1. Click the **Sounds** tab for the **player** sprite.  
2. Click **Choose a Sound** ‚Üí **Loops**, pick a track or import your own.  
3. Delete any unwanted sounds.  
4. Switch to the **Code** tab and attach:

```scratch
   when green flag clicked
    forever
        play sound [YourTrack v] until done
    end
```
- Click the green flag to verify your music loops seamlessly.

Using **play sound until done** ensures the full clip finishes before restarting, avoiding overlaps.

### Step 2. Implement Jumping
```
when [space v] key pressed
    repeat (10)
        change y by (10)
    end
    repeat (10)
        change y by (-10)
    end
```
- Click the spacebar to test‚Äîyour square should rise smoothly and then fall back down.
