## Objective üßê

Add a satisfying ‚Äúbonk‚Äù sound effect when the player collides with a spike, enhancing the Game Over feedback.

## Getting Started with Scratch üö©

### Step 1. Import the Bonk Sound

1. Select the **player** sprite in the Sprites pane.  
2. Click the **Sounds** tab.  
3. Click **Choose a Sound** ‚Üí **Effects** ‚Üí search for **‚ÄúBonk‚Äù** (or upload your own).  
4. Delete any unwanted default sounds.

### Step 2. Play the Sound on Collision

1. Switch to the **Code** tab for the **player** sprite.  
2. Locate your collision script (where you detect `touching color [SpikeOutline]`).  
3. Inside the collision branch‚Äîbefore the `repeat (10)` deceleration loop‚Äîinsert:

```scratch
when green flag clicked
    go to x: (**PUT YOUR PLAYER'S X**) y: (**PUT YOUR PLAYER'S Y**)
    set [scrollSpeed v] to (-10)
    wait until <touching color [#FFFFE0]>
    stop [other scripts in sprite v]

    start sound (Sound v)

    repeat (10)
        change [scrollSpeed v] by (1)
        change x by (scrollSpeed)
    end
```

- This ensures the bonk plays fully before the level decelerates.

### Step 3. Test Your Collision Feedback

1. Click the green flag.

2. Guide your player into a spike.

3. Confirm you hear the ‚Äúbonk‚Äù sound immediately upon impact, followed by the smooth slowdown.

### Step 4. Save Your Progress
