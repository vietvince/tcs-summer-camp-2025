## Objective üßê

Make your level scroll left to simulate player movement by changing the X position of the floor sprite continuously.

## Getting Started with Scratch üö©

### Step 1. Position on Start

1. Select your **floor** (level) sprite.  
2. In the **Scripts** area, create:
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    go to x: (0) y: (0)
```
- This ensures your level begins centered.

### Step 2. Add the Scrolling Loop
1. Still under when green flag clicked, attach a forever block from Control.

2. Inside the forever, add:

3. change x by (-10)

4. from Motion‚Äînegative moves the level left.

5. check if x position reaches a certain point

6. then change the x to the right place

Your complete script should look like:
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    go to x: (0) y: (0)
    forever
        change x by (-10)
        if [(x position) < (-480)] then
            change x by (960)
        end
    end
```
- Click the green flag to test: the floor should drift smoothly to the left.

The backdrop stays fixed; scrolling is achieved by moving the level sprite.

Adjust the ‚Äú‚Äì10‚Äù speed value for faster or slower scroll.
