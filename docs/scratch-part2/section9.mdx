  - You have completed **Geometry Dash 1‚Äì8** (Drawing the Player, Adding Music & Jumping, Level Design, Scrolling the Level, Infinite Scroll with Clones, Adding Spikes & Collision Detection, Smooth Deceleration & Game Over Feel, Collision Sound Effect).  
  - You‚Äôre familiar with the Scratch editor: Costumes tab, clone scripts, and using the `scrollSpeed` variable.

## Objective üßê

Modify your level-clone logic to skip ahead through multiple costumes, enabling arbitrary long or varied level designs by cycling more than two segments.

## Getting Started with Scratch üö©

### Step 1. Prepare Multiple Level Costumes

1. Select your **floor** (level) sprite and open the **Costumes** tab.  
2. Ensure you have at least two base costumes (`level1.1` and `level1.2`) as from Lesson 5.  
3. Create additional costumes (e.g., `level2.1`, `level2.2`, ‚Äúlevel3.1,‚Äù ‚Äúlevel3.2,‚Äù etc.) that represent distinct segments of your level design.  
   - Each costume pair (`.1` and `.2`) can contain different spike patterns, gaps, or decorations.  
   - Number the costumes sequentially so that ‚Äúlevel1.1‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúlevel1.2‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúlevel2.1‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúlevel2.2‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúlevel3.1‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and so on.

### Step 2. Adjust Clone Script to Skip Costumes

1. Open the **Scripts** area for your **floor** sprite.  
2. Locate the `when I start as a clone` script that handles scrolling:

```scratch
when I start as a clone
    show
    go to x: (x position) y: (0)
    forever
        change x by (scrollSpeed)
        if <(x position) < (-480)> then
            change x by (960)
            next costume
        end
    end
```

- Modify the costume‚Äêadvancement logic to skip two costumes at once. Replace the single next costume with:

```scratch
next costume
next costume
```

so the script becomes:

```scratch
when I start as a clone
    show
    go to x: (x position) y: (0)
    forever
    change x by (scrollSpeed)
    if <(x position) < (-480)> then
        change x by (960)
        next costume
        next costume
    end
    end
```

- By advancing two costumes each time a sprite scrolls off‚Äêscreen (‚Äì480 px), you leap from, for example, level1.1 ‚Üí level1.2 ‚Üí level2.1 on that same clone, then on its next loop level2.1 ‚Üí level2.2 ‚Üí level3.1, and so on‚Äîcreating a seamless chain of varied segments.

### Step 3. Test Your Extended Level

1. Click the green flag.

2. Watch your floor clones cycle: each clone should scroll left 480 px, teleport right 960 px, and advance two costumes, producing an infinitely long level composed of all your designed segments.

### Step 4. Adding More Complexity (Optional)

- To introduce branching paths or random segment orders, you can use:

```scratch
if <[randomCondition] = [true]> then
    next costume
    next costume
else
    next costume
    next costume
    next costume
    next costume
end
```
- so clones might skip more or fewer costumes depending on logic.

- Combine with additional clones (beyond two) to overlap three or more segments at once.

- [x] **Fantastic!** Your level now cycles through multiple distinct costumes, enabling complex, arbitrarily long Geometry Dash‚Äìstyle levels.
