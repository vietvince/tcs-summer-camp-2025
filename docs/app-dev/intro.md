Welcome to the **Cookie Clicker** tutorial! In this course, you’ll build a fully-featured incremental “clicker” game from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks required. By the end, you’ll have:

- A clickable cookie that tracks your total clicks  
- Persistent save/load functionality in the browser  
- A shop with multiple building types (“Cursors,” “Grandmas,” etc.)  
- Automatic cookie generation (cookies per second)  
- Upgrade mechanics and balanced progression  

## What You’ll Learn

- **HTML & CSS Setup**: Scaffold your project and style your UI containers.  
- **DOM Manipulation & Events**: Capture clicks, update displays, and wire buttons.  
- **Data Modeling with Classes**: Use ES6 `class` syntax for `Building` and `Upgrade`.  
- **Local Storage & Base64**: Persist game state across page reloads.  
- **Game Loops & Timers**: Implement cookies-per-second logic with `setTimeout`.  
- **Balancing**: Tune costs, effects, and pacing to create satisfying progression.  

## Lesson Flow

1. **Lesson 1 – Project Setup & HTML Structure**  
   Create your folder structure, scaffold `index.html`, and link CSS/JS.  
2. **Lesson 2 – Styling the Cookie & Containers**  
   Flesh out `style.css` to center elements, style buttons, and layout your shop.  
3. **Lesson 3 – Click Logic & Counter Update**  
   Write `game.js` to register clicks and update your cookie count and “cookies-per-click.”  
4. **Lesson 4 – Saving & Loading Game State**  
   Add Base64 utilities and `localStorage` calls so players can save and load their progress.  
5. **Lesson 5 – Building the Shop & Upgrades**  
   Define `Building` and `Upgrade` classes, create your buildings array, and render the shop UI.  
6. **Lesson 6 – Shop Purchase Logic & Game Loop**  
   Implement purchase methods, unlock new buildings, and wire up the main loop for display updates.  
7. **Lesson 7 – Auto-Clickers & Balancing**  
   Calculate cookies-per-second, add auto-generation and display CPS
