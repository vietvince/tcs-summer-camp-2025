  You have completed **Cookie Clicker 1–6**:
  1. Project Setup & HTML  
  2. Styling  
  3. Click Logic  
  4. Saving/Loading  
  5. Shop UI & Upgrades  
  6. Shop Purchase Logic & Game Loop  

  Your **js/game.js** now contains:
  - `Upgrade` & `Building` classes  
  - `game.buildings` array with `baseEffect` defined  
  - `constructShop()`, `updateShop()`  
  - `updateDisplays()` (shows cookies & CPC)  
  - `game.logic()` (loops every second)  
</details>

## Objective 🧐

Extend your game loop so that each building generates cookies automatically (“cookies per second”) and display that rate in the UI.

## Step 1. Query the CPS Display

Open **js/game.js**, scroll to the top where you select your DOM elements, and add:

```js
const displayCPS = document.querySelector('.cpsDisplay');
```
- Now you have displayCPS to show cookies-per-second.

### Step 2. Compute & Add Auto-Cookies

1. Replace your existing game.logic with this:

```js
game.logic = function() {
  // 1. Calculate total cookies per second (CPS)
  let totalCPS = 0;
  game.buildings.forEach(b => {
    totalCPS += b.baseEffect * b.amount;
  });

  // 2. Add auto-cookies to player
  player.cookies += totalCPS;

  // 3. Refresh all displays
  updateDisplays();
  displayCPS.textContent = totalCPS.toFixed(1);

  // 4. Repeat in 1 second
  setTimeout(game.logic, 1000);
};
```

- baseEffect × amount yields each building’s CPS.

- We add that to player.cookies every second.

- displayCPS shows the summed CPS (rounded to one decimal).

### Step 3. Update updateDisplays()

1. If your updateDisplays() currently only updates cookies and CPC, modify it to clear the CPS display before the loop runs:

```js
function updateDisplays() {
  displayTotal.textContent = player.cookies;
  displayCPC.textContent   = player.cookiesPerClick;
  // leave displayCPS to the game.loop code
}
```
(The CPS line stays in game.logic so it updates after each calculation.)

Awesome! You’ve added automatic cookie generation and a live CPS display. Your Cookie Clicker is now fully playable and polished!
