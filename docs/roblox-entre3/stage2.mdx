## Objective üßêüóø

Welcome to the second stage of our thrilling Obby journey! Prepare to elevate your skills as we tackle the challenge of Sphere Stairs and ascend to greater heights!

## Description üìñü™∂

Hey there, brave coders! Are you ready to take your Obby skills to the next stage? Get ready to navigate through a maze of strafing platforms and show off your coding prowess like never before!
 
We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox move side to side between two points. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

**1. Start at a Position:**

The part will start at a certain position. 

**2. Move Side to Side:**

The part will move to one side up to a set distance, then move back to the starting position, and keep repeating this movement. 

**3. Direction Change:**

When the part reaches the set distance on one side, it will change direction and move back to the starting position. 

**4. Smooth Movement:**

The part will move smoothly using a tweening effect, pausing for a short time between movements. 

**By doing this, the part will continuously move side to side in a loop, creating a smooth and continuous animation effect.**

## Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö

### Step 1 - Set Up Starting Variables

- Create a variable to hold the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

- Create a variable for how fast the part will move (`speed`). 

- Create a variable for how far the part will move (`distance`). 

- Make a variable to remember the starting position of the part. 

- Create a variable to set the direction of movement using a vector (`direction`). 

### Step 2 - Create a Function

- Define a function named `moveSideToSide` to hold the moving logic. 

### Step 3 - Make an Infinite Loop

- Inside the function, use a loop that runs forever. In Lua, this is done with `while true do`. 

### Step 4 - Calculate Goal Position

- Calculate the position where the part should move by adding the `direction` multiplied by the `distance` to the starting position (`startPos`). 

### Step 5 - Calculate Distance and Time

- Calculate the distance from the current position to the goal position. 

- Calculate the time it should take to move to the goal position by dividing the distance by the speed. 

### Step 6 - Create a Tween

- Create a `TweenInfo` object with the calculated time and set the easing style to `Linear`. 

- Use the `TweenService` to create a tween that moves the part to the goal position. 

### Step 7 - Play the Tween

- Play the tween and wait for it to complete. 

### Step 8 - Change Direction

- After reaching the goal position, change the direction to the opposite by multiplying the `direction` by -1. 

### Step 9 - Pause the Loop

- Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time, such as 1 second, before repeating the loop. 

### Step 10 - Call the Function

- Outside the function, call `moveSideToSide` to start the movement.

## Putting It All Together üîßüî©

- Start by setting up your starting variables. 

- Define a function named `moveSideToSide` to hold the moving logic. 

- Inside the function, create an infinite loop using `while true do`. 

- Calculate the goal position by adding the `direction` multiplied by the `distance` to the starting position. 

- Calculate the distance to the goal position and the time it should take to move there. 

- Create a `TweenInfo` object with the calculated time and set the easing style to `Linear`. 

- Use the `TweenService` to create a tween that moves the part to the goal position. 

- Play the tween and wait for it to complete. 

- Change the direction to the opposite by multiplying the `direction` by -1. 

- Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time. 

- Outside the function, call `moveSideToSide` to start the movement.

    **Description üìñü™∂** 

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox move up and down continuously using tween animations. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    *1. Move Up and Down:*
    
    The part will move up to a certain distance and then move back down to its original position. 

    *2. Smooth Movement:*
    
    The movement will be smooth and continuous using tweens. 

    *By doing this, the part will create a smooth up and down animation effect.* 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö**

    Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Set the speed of the movement. 

    - Set the distance the part will move up and down. 

    - Store the starting position of the part. 

    - Set the direction of movement to up and down. 

    Step 2 - Create a Function

    - Define a function named `moveUpAndDown`. 

    - Inside the function, create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, calculate the goal position by adding the direction times the distance to the starting position. 

    - Calculate the distance to the goal position. 

    - Calculate the time it should take to move to the goal position by dividing the distance by the speed. 

    - Create `TweenInfo` to define the tween properties (time to move, easing style). 

    - Create a tween to move the part to the goal position. 

    - Play the tween. 

    - Wait for the tween to complete. 

    - Reverse the direction for the next move. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for 1 second before the next move. 

    - Call the `moveUpAndDown` function to start the up and down movement. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together üîßüî©**

    - Start by setting up your part and movement properties. 

    - Define a function named `moveUpAndDown` to handle the continuous movement. 

    - Inside the function, calculate the new positions and create tweens to move the part. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop during each iteration. 

    - Call the `moveUpAndDown` function to start the movement.

    **Description üìñü™∂** 

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox move in a circular path. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    *1. Move in a Circle:*
    
    The part will move in a circular path around a central point. 

    *2. Smooth Movement:*
    
    The movement will be smooth and continuous. 

    *By doing this, the part will create a smooth circular motion.* 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö**

    Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Set the speed of the movement (in degrees per frame). 

    - Set the radius of the circular path. 

    - Store the starting position of the part. 

    - Create a variable for the initial angle in radians (`angle`). 

    Step 2 - Create a Function

    - Define a function named `moveInCircle`. 

    - Inside the function, create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, calculate the new x and z positions based on the current angle using trigonometry (`math.cos` and `math.sin`). 

    - Calculate the new position by adding the calculated x and z values to the starting position. 

    - Move the part to the new calculated position. 

    - Increment the angle for the next frame, converting speed from degrees to radians. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time before the next frame. 

    - Call the `moveInCircle` function to start the circular movement. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together üîßüî©**

    - Start by setting up your part, speed, radius, starting position, and angle variables. 

    - Define a function named `moveInCircle` to handle the circular movement. 

    - Inside the function, calculate the new positions and move the part in a circular path. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop during each iteration. 

    - Call the `moveInCircle` function to start the movement.
