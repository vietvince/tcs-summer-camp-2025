# Lesson 6: The Thrilling Python Turtle Race


So far, you‚Äôve learned how to customize your turtle environment, program your turtle to move around the screen, and use loops and conditional statements to improve your code. 

Now it‚Äôs time for the most important part of your programming journey. In this section, you‚Äôll be implementing all that you‚Äôve learned into a single program by creating a fun game that you can play with your friends.

    <summary>**Prerequisites: Before You Dive In!**</summary>

Before you begin, here‚Äôs what you need to know about the game:
    
    **1. The Objective:**
    
The player whose turtle reaches its home first wins the game.
    
    **2. How to Play:**
    - Each player rolls a dice to get a number.
    - The player then moves their turtle by that many steps.
    - The players alternate turns until one of them wins.

    **3. The Structure:**

    - Each player had a turtle indicated by a different color. You can have more than two players, but for the sake of this tutorial, you‚Äôll be creating a two-player game.
    - Each turtle has a home position that it must reach.
    - Each player uses a die to choose a value at random for their turn. In your program, the die is represented by a list of numbers from 1 to 6.

    Now that you‚Äôve understood the logic of the game, you can go ahead and begin creating it! First, you‚Äôll need to set up the environment.

:::

## Set Up the Environment üåê
Start by importing the Python turtle library. 

After this, import the built-in random library, which you‚Äôll use randomly select an item from a list:

```python
import turtle
import random
```

## Setting Up the Turtles and Homes üê¢ üè†
You now have to create the two turtles that will represent the players. 

Each turtle will be a different color, corresponding to the different players. Here, player one is <span style={{ color: 'green' }}>green</span> and player two is <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>blue</span>:

Try these steps on your own:
1. **Create player one turtle**
2. **Change the turtle's color to green**
3. **Change the turtle's shape to turtle**
4. **Move the turtle's pen up**
5. **Make the turtle move to coordinates (-200,100)**


<details>
    <summary>**Need some help? üëÄ**</summary>

Take a peek at the code below, grab what you need, and continue trying the rest!
```python
player_one = turtle.Turtle()
player_one.color("green")
player_one.shape("turtle")
player_one.penup()
player_one.goto(-200,100)
```
</details>

We will make player two's turtle by clone player one's and changing its color. 

Try these steps on your own:
1. **Create player two turtle**
2. **Change the turtle's color to blue**
3. **Change the turtle's shape to turtle**
4. **Move the turtle's pen up**
5. **Make the turtle move to coordinates (-200,100)**


<details>
    <summary>**Need some help? üëÄ**</summary>

Take a peek at the code below, grab what you need, and continue trying the rest!
``` python
player_two = player_one.clone()
player_two.color("blue")
player_two.penup()
player_two.goto(-200,-100)
```
</details>


Now, set up homes for the turtles, represented by circles. These are their finishing points. Make sure both homes are the same distance from the starting point. 


Try these steps on your own! This will be working on the player one's turtle.
1. **Make the player one turtle move to  (200,60)**
2. **Move the turtle's pen down**
3. **Draw a circle with a radius of 40**
4. **Move the turtle's pen up**
5. **Make the turtle move to coordinates (-200,100)**


<details>
    <summary>**Need some help? üëÄ**</summary>

Take a peek at the code below, grab what you need, and continue trying the rest!
``` python
player_one.goto(200,60)
player_one.pendown()
player_one.circle(40)
player_one.penup()
player_one.goto(-200,100)
```
</details>

Try these steps on your own! This will be working on the player two's turtle.
1. **Make the player two turtle move to (200,-140)**
2. **Move the turtle's pen down**
3. **Draw a circle with a radius of 40**
4. **Move the turtle's pen up**
5. **Make the turtle move to coordinates (-200,100)**


<details>
    <summary>**Need some help? üëÄ**</summary>

Take a peek at the code below, grab what you need, and continue trying the rest!
``` python
player_two.goto(200,-140)
player_two.pendown()
player_two.circle(40)
player_two.penup()
player_two.goto(-200,-100)
```

</details>

After drawing the respective homes, you send the turtles back to their starting positions:

</div>

Awesome! The visual aspects of your game are complete. You can now create the die that you‚Äôll be using to play the game.

## Creating the Die üé≤ ‚ùì
In real life, you might prepare grocery lists and to-do lists to help you stay organized. In Python, lists work in a similar way.

You can create a virtual die for your game with a list, which is an ordered sequence of items. 
 
First, you define your list of numbers in ascending order from 1 to 6. You can define a list by giving it a name and then enclosing its items within square brackets, like this:

```python
die = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

This list has now become your die. To roll the dice, all you have to do is program your system to randomly select a number from it. 
The number that is selected will be considered as the output of the die.

## Developing the Game üïπÔ∏è ‚å®Ô∏è 
It‚Äôs time to develop the code for the rest of the game. You‚Äôll be using loops and conditional statements here, so you need to be careful with the indentations and spaces! 

To start, take a look at the steps your program will need to take to run the game. Try coding this out yourself, keeping your peeks at a minimum!

### Step-by-Step Pseudocode

1. **Initialize loop**:
   - Start a loop that runs 20 times:
     ```pseudo
     FOR i FROM 0 TO 19
     ```

2. **Check player one's position**:
   - If player one's position meets the winning condition:
     ```pseudo
     IF player_one's position >= (200, 100)
       PRINT "Player One Wins!"
       BREAK
     ```

3. **Check player two's position**:
   - If player two's position meets the winning condition:
     ```pseudo
     ELSE IF player_two's position >= (200, -100)
       PRINT "Player Two Wins!"
       BREAK
     ```

4. **Player One's turn**:
   - If neither player has won yet, proceed with player one's turn:
     ```pseudo
     ELSE
       DISPLAY "PLAYER ONE: Press 'Enter' to roll the die"
       CAPTURE player_one's input
       SELECT RANDOMLY a die value
       PRINT "The result of the die roll is: " + die_outcome
       PRINT "The number of steps will be: " + (20 * die_outcome)
       MOVE player_one forward by (20 * die_outcome)
     ```

5. **Player Two's turn**:
   - Continue with player two's turn:
     ```pseudo
     DISPLAY "PLAYER TWO: Press 'Enter' to roll the die"
     CAPTURE player_two's input
     SELECT RANDOMLY a die value
     PRINT "The result of the die roll is: " + die_outcome
     PRINT "The number of steps will be: " + (20 * die_outcome)
     MOVE player_two forward by (20 * die_outcome)
     ```

6. **End of loop**:
   - The loop will either break if a player wins or continue until all 20 iterations are completed.

<details>
    <summary>**Need some help? üëÄ**</summary>

Take a peek at the code below, grab what you need, and continue trying the rest!
``` python
for i in range(20):
    if player_one.pos() >= (200,100):
        print("Player One Wins!")
        break
    elif player_two.pos() >= (200,-100):
        print("Player Two Wins!")
        break
    else:
        player_one_turn = input("PLAYER ONE: Press 'Enter' to roll the die ")
        die_outcome = random.choice(die)
        print("The result of the die roll is: ")
        print(die_outcome)
        print("The number of steps will be: ")
        print(20*die_outcome)
        player_one.fd(20*die_outcome)

        player_two_turn = input("PLAYER TWO: Press 'Enter' to roll the die ")
        die_outcome = random.choice(die)
        print("The result of the die roll is: ")
        print(die_outcome)
        print("The number of steps will be: ")
        print(20*die_outcome)
        player_two.fd(20*die_outcome)
```
</details>

### Code Summary
- **Line 1** sets up a for loop with a range from 1 to 20.

- **Lines 2 through 7** check if either player has reached their goal. If one of them has, then the program prints out the corresponding statement and breaks the loop.

- **Line 8** moves the program on to the next set of steps if neither player has won.

- **Line 9** prints out a statement asking player one to press the Enter key to roll the die.

- **Line 10** takes a random value from the list die and stores it in die_outcome.

- **Line 11** prints a statement prior to displaying the outcome of the dice roll.

- **Line 12** prints the dice outcome.

- **Line 14** multiplies this value by 20 to reduce the overall number of steps required to complete the game.

- **Line 15** moves player one‚Äôs turtle forward by this number of steps.

- **Lines 16 to 22** repeat these steps for player two.

The entire for loop is repeated until one of the player‚Äôs turtles reaches the final position.


## Conclusion üèÅ üèÅ

Wow, we've finally made it to the end! Over these past sections, we really dived into the turtle library and became comfortable with the basics as well as some advanced features. 

You've learned how to create various shapes, control the speed and color of your turtle, and even animate simple drawings. Now you've got a cool game to show off to your friends and family.


Take this, you deserve it!
