    <summary>**Prerequisites - Before You Dive In!**</summary>

    Hey there, future coding champions! Before we dive into our epic Turtle adventure, let's make sure we're all set with these fun and essential skills:

    [**Environment Exploration**](https://trinket.io/home): Trinket is an online platform where you can write, run, and share Python programs directly in your web browser. There is no installation needed and we get to see what our code does right away. We’ll be referring to Trinket as our Python environment.

    [**Turtle Documentation**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html): It's time to put your thinking cap on! Learn the basics of Turtle graphics and discover how to create and shape intricate designs like a true coding artist. Who knew coding with Python Turtle could be so artsy?

    So, gear up and get ready to embark on this exciting coding journey. With these skills under your belt, you'll be unstoppable! 🚀💻

## Objective 🧐🗿

Hey there, future Python masters! Are you ready to kickstart our coding adventure? Let's set up our environment and get ready to unleash our creativity!

## Sign up for Trinket 💡:white_check_mark:

Head over to [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) and sign up for a free account. This will be your digital playground where we'll bring our Python Turtle creations to life! It's like getting your very own art studio, ready for all your coding masterpieces.

### Prepare Your Creative Space

Once you're signed in, make a New Trinket and select Python. You'll see a blank canvas on the right and a code editor on the left. This is where the magic happens! Think of it as your blank canvas, just waiting for your imagination to take flight.

Go ahead and name your file "TCS Turtle". This is the file we'll use for our lessons.

### Voila! Your Workspace is Ready
Head over to **My Trinkets**. In that section there will already be some preloaded projects with examples of Python Turtle in action. Check out **Teaching with Turtle** and get a glimpse of the amazing things you can create. It's a great way to get inspired and see the potential of Turtle graphics!
