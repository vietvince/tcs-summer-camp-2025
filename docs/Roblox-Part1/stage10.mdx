    Ready to tackle the ultimate challenge? Let‚Äôs dive into the mind-bending adventure of Stage 10: Puzzle Room! Prepare to push your limits as you solve clever puzzles and unlock the secrets of this tricky room. Are you up for the challenge?    

    **Description**

    We are going to create a script that makes buttons in Roblox follow a specific order. When the buttons are pressed in the correct order, a wall will be destroyed. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Define Button Order:**
    
    The script will have a specific order in which buttons need to be pressed. 

    **Step 2 - Check Button Presses:**
    
    The script will check if the buttons are pressed in the correct order. 

    **Step 3 - Play Sounds:**
    
    The script will play a sound when the correct or incorrect button is pressed. 

    **Step 4 - Destroy Wall:**
    
    When all buttons are pressed in the correct order, a wall will be destroyed, and the buttons will be removed. 

    By doing this, we will create a fun challenge for players to press the buttons in the correct order to destroy the wall. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the order of button colors (`buttonOrder`). 

    - Create a variable to keep track of the current button index (`currentButtonIndex`). 

    - Create variables for the red, green, and blue buttons by setting them to their respective parents (`redButton`, `greenButton`, `blueButton`). 

    - Create a table to store references to all the buttons (`buttons`). 

    - Create variables for the correct and incorrect sounds (`correctSound`, `incorrectSound`). 

    **Step 2 - Create the Functions:**

    - Define a function named `checkButtonOrder` that takes a `buttonPressed` argument. 

    - Inside the function, check if the `buttonPressed` matches the current button in the order. 

    - If correct, play the correct sound and move to the next button in the order. 

    - If all buttons are pressed correctly, destroy the wall and remove the buttons. 

    - If incorrect, reset the button index and play the incorrect sound. 

    - Define a function named `buttonClicked` that takes a `color` argument. 

    - Return a function that calls `checkButtonOrder` with the given color. 

    - Connect the `buttonClicked` function to each button's `MouseClick` event, passing the respective color. 

    <br  />
    
    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your button order, index, buttons, and sounds. 

    - Define a function named `checkButtonOrder` to handle checking the button presses. 

    - Define a function named `buttonClicked` to handle button clicks. 

    - Connect the `buttonClicked` function to each button's `MouseClick` event.
