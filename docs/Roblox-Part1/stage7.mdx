## Objective üßêüóø

Welcome to the electrifying challenge of Stage 7: Rolling Rocks! Prepare to conquer the rocky terrain as you navigate through a maze of boulders and obstacles. Get ready to dodge, duck, and dive as you face the relentless onslaught of falling rocks.

## Step 1 - Creating the Rocky Slide ‚ö†Ô∏èü™®

Let's get ready to roll through the rocky terrain! No worries, because your Code Coach will help you place those boulders just right. Here's how we do it:

</div>

### 1.1 Constructing the Ramp

Let's kick things off by building a ramp:
- Using a Wedge Part, make sure it's sturdy and smooth!
- Create a wide cover spot along the ramp to provide a safe zone from the falling boulders!
- Get creative and jazz up your ramp and cover with colors and materials of your choice!

### 1.2 Adding the Boulder Spawner

Lets get rolling with those boulders!
- Head over to the Toolbox and look for the talented creator, "55hpmonk".
- Grab the "BoulderSpawner" asset and bring it into your workspace.
- Strategically place the BoulderSpawners along the top of the ramp.
- Customize each BoulderSpawner with your preferred Color and Material.
- Adjust the Color and Material of the spawned boulders by tweaking the variables in the Script.

    <br  />
    
    **1.1 Constructing the Ramp**

    Lets create the mountain that our boulders will fall from!
    - Get your creative juices flowing by designing a long pathway using a Wedge Part.
    - Remember to leave space for multiple cover spots where our fearless adventurers can seek refuge.
    - And don't forget to add your own unique touch to the ramp and cover with colors and materials that reflect your style!

    **1.2 Adding the Boulder Spawner**

    Now, let's bring on the action by rolling out the rocks! 
    - Head over to the toolbox and search for "55hpmonk".
    - Find the "BoulderSpawner" asset and import it into the game
    - Strategically place the BoulderSpawners along the top of the ramp.
    - Customize them with your preferred colors and materials.
    - Don't hesitate to tweak the variables in the Script to make those boulders truly rock!

    **If you want more of a challenge by recreating the video yourself, follow these steps:**

    For those seeking an extra challenge in Stage 7's rolling rocks chaos, get ready to up the ante with some moving cover madness! Here's how to take it to the next stage:
 
    **Description**

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox move back and forth smoothly using tweens. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Set Up Movement:**
    
    The part will start at its initial position and move to a new position 10 studs away. 

    **Step 2 - Smooth Movement:**
    
    The part will move smoothly using a tween, taking 2 seconds for each movement. 

    **Step 3 - Repeat Movement:**
    
    The part will keep moving back and forth forever. 

    By doing this, the part will continuously move back and forth, creating a smooth animation effect. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Get the `TweenService` from the game. 

    - Create a variable for the starting position of the part (`startPos`). 

    - Create a variable for the ending position 10 studs away from the starting position (`endPos`). 

    - Create a `TweenInfo` object that defines how the tween will behave: 

        - Duration: 2 seconds. 

        - Easing style: Linear (smooth and consistent speed). 

        - Easing direction: Out (slows down at the end). 

        - Repeat count: -1 (infinite repeats). 

        - Reverses: true (moves back and forth). 

        - Delay time: 0 seconds (no delay). 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function:** 

    - Define a function named `startTween`. 

    - Inside the function, create a tween that moves the part from `startPos` to `endPos`. 

    - Connect a function to the tween's `Completed` event to swap `startPos` and `endPos` when the tween finishes, and then restart the tween. 

    - Start the tween by calling the `Play` method. 

    - Call the `startTween` function to begin the movement. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your part, tween service, and positions. 

    - Create a `TweenInfo` object to define the tween behavior. 

    - Define a function named `startTween` to create and manage the tween. 

    - Inside the function, create a tween to move the part and handle the completion event. 

    - Start the tween to begin the movement. 

    - Call the `startTween` function to kick off the process. 

    {/* <br  />
 
    **Extra Points Challenge:**

    Gear up for the ultimate test! Duplicate and apply this code across all your boulders. Then, push your boundaries and showcase your mastery of the rolling rock chaos. Are you prepared to triumph, earning the recognition of your fellow adventurers and the admiration of your Code Coach?

    Remember, while this challenge may be tough, don't hesitate to seek guidance from your Code Coach if needed. But if you can conquer this feat solo, you'll earn some serious coding accolades!
    
    So, gear up, intrepid coders, and brace yourselves for the moving cover mayhem of **Stage 7 - Hard**! Let's roll! üöÄüíª */}
