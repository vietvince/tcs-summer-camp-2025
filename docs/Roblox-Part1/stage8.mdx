    **Description**

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox spin continuously and cause any player who touches it to lose all their health. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Spin the Part:**
    
    The part will spin around smoothly. 

    **Step 2 - Detect Touch:**

    The script will detect when a player touches the spinning part. 

    **Step 3 - Affect the Player:**
    
    If a player touches the part, their health will be set to 0. 

    By doing this, we will create a spinning part that creates a challenge for players in the game. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Create a variable for the speed of the spin (`spinSpeed`). 

    **Step 2 - Create the Functions:**

    - Define a function named `rotatePart` that spins the part. 

    - Inside the function, update the part's rotation using `CFrame` and the `spinSpeed`. 

    - Define a function named `onPartTouched` that checks if something touching the part is a player. 

    - Inside the function, if the part that touched has a "Humanoid" (indicating a player), set the player's health to 0. 

    - Use the `RunService.Heartbeat` event to call the `rotatePart` function continuously, making the part spin. 

    - Connect the `onPartTouched` function to the part's `Touched` event to detect when it is touched. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your spinning part and spin speed. 

    - Define a function named `rotatePart` to make the part spin. 

    - Define a function named `onPartTouched` to handle when the part is touched. 

    - Use the `RunService.Heartbeat` event to call the `rotatePart` function continuously. 

    - Connect the `onPartTouched` function to the part's `Touched` event.

    **Extra Points Challenge:**

    Prepare yourself for the ultimate challenge! Change up the Scripts across all your spinning kill bricks. Then, test your limits and demonstrate your expertise in navigating through the spinning chaos. Are you ready to emerge victorious, earning the respect of your fellow adventurers and the admiration of your Code Coach?

    While this challenge may present obstacles, don't hesitate to seek guidance from your Code Coach if necessary. However, if you can conquer this task independently, you'll earn some serious coding accolades!

    So, gear up, courageous coders, and get ready to face the spinning madness of **Stage 8 - Hard**! Let's spin! üöÄüíª */}
