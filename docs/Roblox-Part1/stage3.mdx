    <summary>**Hard: Get ready for some chaos as we swap planks around for an extra twist!**</summary>

    **If you want more of a challenge by recreating the video yourself, follow these steps:**

    Hey fearless adventurers! Stage 3 just got a whole lot trickier, but I know you're up for the challenge! Get ready to swap those planks and bring on the chaos ‚Äì but remember, your Code Coach is always here to lend a hand if you need it. Let's dive in and see if you can tackle this challenge all on your own!

    **Description** 

    We are going to create a script that makes three parts in Roblox swap positions randomly. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Start with Three Parts:**
    
    We will have three parts in our game. 

    **Step 2 - Swap Positions**
    
    The parts will switch places with each other randomly. 

    **Step 3 - Keep Swapping:**
    
    The parts will keep swapping positions continuously, creating a fun effect. 

    By doing this, the parts will keep moving to each other's positions randomly, making the game more interesting. 

    <br  />
    
    **Instructions and Code Logic** 

    **Step 1 - Set Up Starting Variables:**

    - Create variables for each of the three parts (`part1`, `part2`, and `part3`). 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function:**

    - Define a function named `swapPositions` that takes two parts (`partA` and `partB`) and swaps their positions. 

    **Step 3 - Make an Infinite Loop:**

    - Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    **Step 4 - Choose a Random Swap:**

    - Inside the loop, choose a random number between 1 and 3. 

    **Step 5 - Swap Based on Random Choice:**

    - If the random number is 1, swap the positions of `part1` and `part2`. 

    - If the random number is 2, swap the positions of `part2` and `part3`. 

    - If the random number is 3, swap the positions of `part3` and `part1`. 

    **Step 6 - Pause the Loop:**

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time, such as 2 seconds, before repeating the loop. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your three parts. 

    - Define a function named `swapPositions` that swaps the positions of two parts. 

    - Create an infinite loop using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, choose a random number between 1 and 3. 

    - Swap the positions of the parts based on the random number. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time. 

    - Repeat the loop to keep swapping the parts' positions randomly.

    **Extra Points Challenge:**

    Feeling up for a challenge? Take your completed script and duplicate it onto the remaining planks. Can you conquer this stage solo, without any assistance from your Code Coach? It's time to put your skills to the test and strive for that flawless run!

    But remember, even the greatest heroes need support from time to time. If you find yourself in need of guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to your Code Coach. However, if you're able to conquer this challenge independently, you'll earn some serious coding bragging rights!

    So, gear up, fearless coders, and prepare to conquer the dynamic platforms of **Stage 3 - Hard**! Your coding journey awaits! üöÄüíª */}
