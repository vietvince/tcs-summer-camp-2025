## Objective üßêüóø

Welcome to the first stage of our exciting Obby adventure! Get ready to climb to new heights as we conquer the Ascending Walls!

## Step 1 - Create the First Checkpoint üö©

Let's kick things off by setting up our checkpoint. It's like marking the start of our epic journey!

### 1.1 Select the SpawnLocation
Find the SpawnLocation and get ready to customize.

### 1.2 Customize Properties
Here's where the magic happens!

- Choose a color that screams "awesome" to you.

    **Description**

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox move up and down between two heights. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Start at a Position:**
    
    The part will start at a certain position. 

    **Step 2 - Move Up and Down:**
    
    The part will move up to a maximum height, then move down to a minimum height, and keep repeating this movement. 

    **Step 3 - Direction Change:**
    
    When the part reaches the maximum height, it will change direction and start moving down. When it reaches the minimum height, it will change direction and start moving up again. 

    **Step 4 - Smooth Movement:**
    
    The part will move smoothly, pausing for a short time during each step of movement. 

    By doing this, the part will continuously move up and down in a loop, creating a nice animation effect. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic** 

    **Step 1 - Set Up Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable to hold the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Make a variable to remember the starting position of the part. 

    - Create variables for the highest point (`maxHeight`), lowest point (`minHeight`), and how fast it moves (`speed`). 

    - Create a true/false variable (`goingUp`) to know if the part is moving up, starting with `true`. 

    **Step 2 - Make an Infinite Loop:**

    - Use a loop that runs forever. In Lua, this is done with `while true do`. 

    **Step 3 - Check the Direction:**

    - Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to see if the part is moving up. This is checked using the `goingUp` variable. 

    **Step 4 - Move the Part Up:**

    - If `goingUp` is `true`, change the part's position to move it up. Use a vector to do this. 

    - Specifically, add to the Y-coordinate by the speed value. 

    **Step 5 - Check Maximum Height:**

    - After moving the part up, check if the part's Y-coordinate has reached or gone above the `maxHeight`. 

    - If it has, set `goingUp` to `false` to start moving down. 

    **Step 6 - Move the Part Down:**

    - If `goingUp` is `false`, change the part's position to move it down. Use a vector to do this. 

    - Specifically, subtract from the Y-coordinate by the speed value. 

    **Step 7 - Check Minimum Height:**

    - After moving the part down, check if the part's Y-coordinate has reached or gone below the `minHeight`. 

    - If it has, set `goingUp` to `true` to start moving up again. 

    **Step 8 - Pause the Loop:**

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time, like 0.1 seconds, before repeating the loop. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your starting variables. 

    - Create an infinite loop using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check the direction (`goingUp`). 

    - If `goingUp` is `true`, move the part up by adding to its Y-coordinate using a vector. 

    - Check if the part's Y position has reached the maximum height. If it has, set `goingUp` to `false`. 

    - If `goingUp` is `false`, move the part down by subtracting from its Y-coordinate using a vector. 

    - Check if the part's Y position has reached the minimum height. If it has, set `goingUp` to `true`. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time. 

    - Repeat the loop to keep the part moving up and down.
