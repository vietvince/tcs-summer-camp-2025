### 1.3 Tweaking the Script

To ensure your kill wall moves smoothly across the hallway:
- Adjust the speed of its movement to fit the pace.
- Edit the end index of the "for" loop.
    - Calculated using the hallway's Z-Value divided by the speed.

Don't hesitate to ask your Code Coach for help if you're stuck!

        <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;border:3px solid #47c621;">

    **Description** 

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox change its color and whether it can be collided with or not. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Change Color:**
    
    The part will switch between green and red. 

    **Step 2 - Toggle Collision:**
    
    The part will change whether it can be collided with or not when it changes color. 

    **Step 3 - Repeat Continuously:**
    
    The part will keep changing color and collision status in a loop. 

    By doing this, the part will keep switching colors and collision states, creating an interesting effect. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Create a variable for the green color. 

    - Create a variable for the red color. 

    - Create a variable for the delay between swaps (`swapDelay`). 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function:**

    - Define a function named `swapColor`. 

    - Inside the function, change the part's color to green and set `CanCollide` to false. 

    - Pause the function for the `swapDelay`. 

    - Change the part's color to red and set `CanCollide` to true. 

    - Pause the function for the `swapDelay`. 

    **Step 3 - Create an Infinite Loop:**

    - Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, call the `swapColor` function to keep swapping the part's color and collision status. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your part and color variables. 

    - Define a function named `swapColor` to change the part's color and collision status. 

    - Inside the function, switch the part's color and collision state and pause for the `swapDelay`. 

    - Create an infinite loop using `while true do` to keep calling the `swapColor` function.

    **Extra Points Challenge:**

    Prepare for the ultimate trial! Apply this code to all your doorways and witness the chaos unfold. Push your limits and demonstrate your mastery over the flickering doorway mayhem. Are you ready to conquer this challenge, earning the respect of your fellow adventurers and the admiration of your Code Coach?

    While this challenge may seem daunting, don't hesitate to seek guidance from your Code Coach if needed. However, if you can conquer this feat independently, you'll earn prestigious coding accolades!

    So, gear up, bold coders, and prepare yourselves for the flickering frenzy of **Stage 9 - Hard**! Let the adventure begin! üöÄüíª */}
