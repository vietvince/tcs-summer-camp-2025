## Objective 🧐🗿

Hey there, future Obby masters! Are you ready to kickstart our coding adventure? Let's set up our workspace and get ready to unleash our creativity!

## Step 1 - Load up the Template 💡:white_check_mark:

Fire up Roblox Studio and select the first Baseplate template. It's like starting with a blank canvas, waiting for your coding masterpiece!

</div>

### 1.2 Get Ready to Build

One of the key challenges in our Obby is staying on course. To make things interesting, we'll need to remove the Baseplate. Head over to the Explorer tab, find the Baseplate under Workspace, and delete it. Say goodbye to the ground and get ready to soar through the skies of coding creativity!

### 1.3 Voila! Your Workspace is Ready

Take a look around - your workspace should now be clear and ready for action! It's like a blank canvas, just waiting for you to fill it with your coding dreams.
