# Part 3: Enable OpenXR (or Your Headset’s XR Plugin)

The “XR Plugin Management” lets Unity talk to your VR headset. We’ll use OpenXR, which works on most headsets (Quest, Rift, Vive, Index, etc.).

## 3. Enable OpenXR (or Your Headset’s XR Plugin)

1. Go to **Edit → Project Settings…**  
2. In the left sidebar, select **XR Plug-in Management**.  
3. At the top, check **Initialize XR on Startup**.  
4. Under **Plug-in Providers → PC, Mac & Linux Standalone**, check **OpenXR**.  
   - (If you don’t see OpenXR, you may need to install **OpenXR Plugin** first via Package Manager—search “OpenXR Plugin” and install it.)  
5. Click **OpenXR** under the XR Plug-in list (just below).  
   - In the **Features** list, check the controller profiles matching your hardware:  
     - **Oculus Touch Controller Profile** (for Oculus devices)  
     - **HTC Vive Controller Profile**  
     - **Valve Index Controller Profile**  
     - …or any other profile that corresponds to your controllers.  
6. *(If you plan to build to Quest/Android)* also check **OpenXR** under the **Android** section.  

Close **Project Settings** when you’re done.

### Why?

- The **XR Plug-in Management** system ensures Unity loads the correct runtime to communicate with your headset.  
- **OpenXR** is a cross-platform API that covers most major VR headsets, reducing the need for multiple plugins.  
- Enabling the appropriate controller profiles lets Unity recognize and map button inputs from your VR controllers.
