# Part 4: Set Up the Basic VR “Player Rig”

## 4. Set Up the Basic VR “Player Rig”

1. In the **Hierarchy** window, delete the default **Main Camera** (select it and press **Delete**).

2. In the top menu, go to **GameObject → XR → XR Origin (Action-based)**.  
   This creates an **XR Origin** GameObject with the following structure:  
   ```text
   XR Origin (Action-based)
   ├─ Camera Offset
   │    └─ Main Camera  (tagged MainCamera)
   ├─ LeftHand Controller
   └─ RightHand Controller
    ```
3. Expand XR Origin → Camera Offset → Main Camera.

- The Main Camera has a Tracked Pose Driver component. This automatically moves the camera to match your VR headset’s position and rotation.

4. Expand XR Origin → LeftHand Controller.

- You should see an XR Controller (Action-based) component and an XR Ray Interactor component. These allow you to point a laser beam for teleporting or interacting with objects.

5. Expand XR Origin → RightHand Controller.

- Similarly, it should have XR Controller (Action-based) and XR Ray Interactor components.

- Tip: If either controller is missing one of these components, select the controller in the Hierarchy, click Add Component, and search for “XR Controller (Action-based)” and “XR Ray Interactor” to add them manually.

You can now press Play ▶ and put on your VR headset. You should see either a blank floor (once you create one) or a black void, but your head movements will be tracked. Press Play ▶ again to stop.
