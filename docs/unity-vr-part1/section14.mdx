  - Size = **(0.4, 0.01, 0.4)**  
  - **BBScore** component attached, with **BBScoreText** assigned.

- **Basketball Prefabs (Basketball1/2/3)** under **Assets/Prefabs**  
  For each prefab:
  - Sphere Collider + Rigidbody (**Mass = 0.6**, Freeze X/Z rotations) + XR Grab Interactable  
  - Tag = **Basketball1**, **Basketball2**, or **Basketball3**  
  - Instantiated in the scene at:
    - **Basketball1**: (−2, 0.5, 3)  
    - **Basketball2**: (0, 0.5, 3)  
    - **Basketball3**: (2, 0.5, 3)

- **DeathZone** (Empty)  
  - Positioned at **(0, −2, 0)** with Box Collider (non-trigger), Scale = **(10, 1, 10)**  
  - **RespawnItems** component attached, with references assigned:
    - **BBStart1**, **BBStart2**, **BBStart3**, and **PistolStart**

- **Start-Position Empties**

  - **BBStart3** at **(2, 0.5, 3)**  
  - **PistolStart** at **(2, 0.5, −3)**

- **Pistol** (Cube) at **(2, 0.5, −3)**  
  - Box Collider, Rigidbody (**Mass = 1**), XR Grab Interactable, Tag = **Pistol**  
  - Child empty **SpawnPoint** at local **(0, 0, 0.3)**  
  - **FireBulletOnActivate** component attached, with:
    - **Bullet.prefab** assigned  
    - **SpawnPoint** assigned

- **Bullet.prefab** under **Assets/Prefabs**  
  - Sphere Collider, Rigidbody (**Mass = 0.1**), Tag = **bullet**

- **Targets**  
  - **Target_1pt** at (−4, 1, 0), red material, Box Collider (Is Trigger = false), **ShootingPoint1** attached (with **ShootingScoreText** assigned)  
  - **Target_5pt** at (0, 1, −2), blue material, Box Collider, **ShootingPoint5** attached (with **ShootingScoreText** assigned)  
  - **Target_10pt** at (4, 1, 0), green material, Box Collider, **ShootingPoint10** attached (with **ShootingScoreText** assigned)

- **ShootingCanvas** (World Space)  
  - Positioned at **(−0.5, 1.8, 0.5)**, Rotation = **(0, 180, 0)**, Scale = **(0.002, 0.002, 0.002)**

    - **Pinch Animation Action** = **LeftHand Pinch**  
    - **Grip Animation Action** = **LeftHand Grip**  
    - **Hand Animator** = the Animator component  
  - **XR Origin → RightHand Controller → Hands-Right → Hand (Animator)** has **AnimateHandOnInput** with:  
    - **Pinch Animation Action** = **RightHand Pinch**  
    - **Grip Animation Action** = **RightHand Grip**  
    - **Hand Animator** = the Animator component

## Play-Testing

Once all of the above are configured correctly, press **Play ▶** and put on your VR headset:

1. **Teleport**  
   - Hold the controller’s teleport button, aim at the floor, release to teleport anywhere on the floor.

2. **Hand Animation**  
   - Squeeze your index trigger → your virtual hand pinches.  
   - Squeeze your grip → your hand closes.

3. **Grab & Throw Basketballs**  
   - Grip to pick up a ball (Basketball1/2/3), move your hand, and release → the ball flies.  
   - If it passes through **HoopTrigger**, the **BBScoreText** increments by 1.

4. **Shoot Targets**  
   - Grip and hold the pistol, point at a 1-point (red), 5-point (blue), or 10-point (green) board, fully pull (activate) the trigger → the pistol spawns a bullet forward.  
   - When a bullet hits a board, the **ShootingScoreText** updates accordingly (adds 1, 5, or 10 points).

5. **Out-of-Bounds Respawn**  
   - If a ball or pistol falls through the floor (below Y ≈ –1.5), it collides with **DeathZone** and teleports back to its start position.

6. **Maze Exit**  
   - Walk or teleport into the **MazeTeleporter** box → the scene reloads.  
   - Both scores reset to zero, and all items respawn at their start positions.

Now everything is ready—enjoy play-testing your VR Basketball Maze!
