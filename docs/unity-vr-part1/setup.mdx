## Objective üßêüóø

Welcome, future VR developers! In this setup, you‚Äôll spend some time getting everything ready for VR development in Unity. By the end of this section, you should have:

- A working Unity installation compatible with VR (URP template recommended).  
- The XR Interaction Toolkit and Input System packages installed.  
- Your Meta Quest (or other headset) connected and configured in Unity.  
- Confidence navigating the Unity Editor in preparation for VR tasks.

### Key Goals

- **Install/Update Unity**  
  - Use Unity Hub to install the latest LTS version (2020.3 or newer).  
  - Confirm you‚Äôre on a version that supports OpenXR and URP.

- **Familiarize with the Scene View**  
  - Practice panning, orbiting, and zooming in Scene view so you can position VR cameras and objects easily.  
  - Try holding the right-mouse button and moving the mouse to orbit, middle-mouse to pan, and scroll wheel to zoom.

- **Connect Your VR Headset**  
  - Plug in your Meta Quest (via Link/Air Link) or set up your Rift/Vive according to manufacturer instructions.  
  - Verify in Windows (or macOS, if supported) that the headset is recognized and ready for Unity.

- **Install Required Packages**  
  - In Unity‚Äôs Package Manager, add the Input System and XR Interaction Toolkit‚Äîthese enable controller input, grabbing, and teleportation features.

## Description üìùüîç

This course focuses on building a VR basketball-and-shooting maze game, but the setup steps you follow here will apply to virtually any VR project in Unity.

### Install Unity via Unity Hub

1. **Open Unity Hub** (download from [unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download) if you don‚Äôt have it).  
2. Go to the **Installs** tab and click **Add**.  
3. Choose **Unity 2020.3 LTS** (or newer).  
   - Include **Android Build Support** if you plan to build for Meta Quest.  
   - Include **Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)** for PC-based headsets (Rift, Vive).  
4. Once installation finishes, confirm Unity Hub shows your new Unity version under **Installs**.

### Create a New Project in URP

1. In Unity Hub‚Äôs **Projects** tab, click **New**.  
2. Select the **3D (Universal Render Pipeline)** template‚Äîthis gives you better VR performance and up-to-date shaders.  
3. Name your project **VR Basketball Maze** and choose a folder (e.g., `~/Unity/VR_Basketball_Maze`).  
4. Click **Create**. Unity will open the Editor with a brand-new URP project.

### Install the Input System & XR Interaction Toolkit

1. In Unity‚Äôs top menu, go to **Window ‚Üí Package Manager**.  
2. In Package Manager‚Äôs dropdown (upper left), select **Unity Registry**.  
3. Search for **Input System**, click **Install**.  
   - When prompted to **Restart and enable new Input System**, choose **Yes**. Unity will reload.  
4. Reopen **Window ‚Üí Package Manager**.  
5. Search for **XR Interaction Toolkit**, click **Install**.  
   - When asked to **Import default input actions**, choose **Yes**.  
6. Close the Package Manager.

### Enable OpenXR

1. Go to **Edit ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí XR Plug-in Management**.  
2. Check **Initialize XR on Startup** at the top.  
3. Under **Plug-in Providers ‚Üí PC, Mac & Linux Standalone**, enable **OpenXR**.  
   - If you plan to build for Quest (Android), also check **OpenXR** under **Android**.  
4. Click **OpenXR** in the left panel and enable the controller profiles you need (e.g., **Oculus Touch Controller Profile**, **HTC Vive Controller Profile**).  
5. Close Project Settings.

### Connect and Test Your Headset

1. **Meta Quest / Quest 2** (via Link or Air Link):  
   - Plug the USB-C cable into your PC or enable Air Link in Quest‚Äôs settings.  
   - In Unity, press **Play**. Put on your Quest‚Äîif everything is set up, you should see the empty scene in VR.

2. **Oculus Rift / Rift S**:  
   - Open the Oculus PC app, put on your headset, and verify it‚Äôs in ‚ÄúPassthrough‚Äù or ‚ÄúOculus Home.‚Äù  
   - Press **Play** in Unity‚Äîyour Rift should display the empty scene.

3. **HTC Vive / Vive Pro**:  
   - Make sure SteamVR is running and your Vive is tracked in SteamVR Home.  
   - Press **Play** in Unity; the Vive view should render the scene.

4. **Valve Index**:  
   - Open SteamVR and confirm your Index is tracking.  
   - Hit **Play** in Unity to see the VR editor view.

> **Tip:** If you see a warning about ‚ÄúNo XR device found,‚Äù double-check your headset connection, USB cables, and that OpenXR is enabled in Project Settings.

### Explore the Unity Editor

- **Scene View Controls**  
  - **Orbit:** Hold right-mouse button + move mouse.  
  - **Pan:** Hold middle-mouse button (or Alt + left-mouse) + move.  
  - **Zoom:** Scroll wheel or hold right-mouse + W/S keys.  

- **Play Mode in VR**  
  - Click **Play ‚ñ∂** in Unity and watch your headset‚Äôs view update in real time.  
  - Use controller joysticks or touchpads to see if any default teleportation or ray appears (some XR samples include basic teleport).

- **Asset Store Resources**  
  - Explore free VR assets at [Unity Asset Store ‚Üí Tags ‚Üí VR](https://assetstore.unity.com/).  
  - Import sample hand models or VR toolkits if you want extra references.

## Tips for a Smooth VR Setup

- **Keep Unity Updated**  
  - Regularly check Unity Hub for updates. Newer versions include bug fixes and improved OpenXR support.  
  - Avoid switching versions mid-tutorial; stick with the same LTS release you installed at the start.

- **Install Matching Oculus/SteamVR Plugins**  
  - If you plan to target Oculus specifically, you can install the **Oculus XR Plugin** (via Package Manager) in addition to OpenXR.  
  - For Vive/Index, ensure **Windows XR Plugin** or **SteamVR Plugin** is installed if you run into tracking issues.

- **Check Your USB & Drivers**  
  - For Quest Link, use a high-quality USB 3.0 cable.  
  - For Rift/Vive/Index, verify all headset and controller drivers are up to date in Windows Device Manager.

- **Test Early and Often**  
  - After each major step (project creation, package install, OpenXR enable), press **Play ‚ñ∂** and confirm your headset displays the scene.  
  - Fix any errors or missing references before moving on to scripting or level design.

You‚Äôre now ready to start building your VR basketball-and-shooting maze game! Proceed to Section 1: **Create a New Unity Project**, and let‚Äôs bring your VR vision to life.
