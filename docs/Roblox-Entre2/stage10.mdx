## Objective 🧐🗿

We are going to create a script that knocks out (sets health to zero) all players in the game except one exempted player. 

## Description 📖🪶

Here's what we want to accomplish:

**1. Identify Players:**

Get a list of all players in the game. 

**2. Exempt One Player:**

Skip the player who is exempted. 

**3. Knock Out Players:**

Set the health of all other players to zero. 

**By doing this, we can create a function that can selectively knock out all players except for a specified one.** 

## Instructions and Code Logic 📝📚

### Step 1 - Get Necessary Services

- Get the `Players` service from the game. 

### Step 2 - Create a Function to Knock Out Players

- Define a function named `randomKnockout` that takes an `exemptedPlayer` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, define another function named `makeDie` that takes a `player` as an argument. 

- Inside `makeDie`, get the player's character and check if it has a `Humanoid` component. 

- If the `Humanoid` component exists, set its health to zero. 

### Step 3 - Iterate Through All Players

- Use a loop to go through all players in the game. 

- For each player, check if they are not the exempted player. 

- If they are not the exempted player, call the `makeDie` function to knock them out. 

## Putting It All Together 🔧🔩

- Start by setting up the necessary services. 

- Define the `randomKnockout` function to handle the logic of knocking out all players except one. 

- Inside the function, define `makeDie` to set the player's health to zero. 

- Iterate through all players and knock out those who are not exempted. 

**By following these simple steps, you can create a script that knocks out all players except for one specified player.**
