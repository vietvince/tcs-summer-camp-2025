## Objective 🧐🗿

We are going to create a script that allows players to purchase invulnerability for their character in Roblox using a Developer Product.

## Description 📖🪶 

Here's what we want to accomplish: 

**1. Purchase Invulnerability:**

Players can buy invulnerability for their character using a Developer Product. 

**2. Make Character InvulnerableL:**

When purchased, the character will become invulnerable for a short duration. 

**3. Restore Vulnerability:**

After the duration, the character will return to being vulnerable. 

**By doing this, we will create a dynamic gameplay feature where players can temporarily make their character invulnerable through in-game purchases.** 

## Instructions and Code Logic 📝📚

### Step 1 - Get the Necessary Services

- Get the `MarketplaceService` from the game. 

- Get the `Players` service from the game. 

### Step 2 - Set Up Developer Product ID

- Define the Developer Product ID for the invulnerability purchase (`DEV_PRODUCT_INVULNERABILITY`). 

### Step 3 - Create a Function to Handle Invulnerability

- Define a function named `grantInvulnerability` that takes a `player` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, get the player's character. 

- For each part of the character, if it's a `BasePart`, set its `CanTouch` property to `false`. 

- Wait for 3 seconds (the duration of the invulnerability). 

- After the wait, set the `CanTouch` property of each part back to `true`. 

### Step 4 - Create a Function to Process Receipts

- Define a function named `processReceipt` that takes `receiptInfo` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, get the player from the receipt information. 

- If the player is not found, return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.NotProcessedYet`. 

- Use a `pcall` to handle any errors during processing. 

- If the `ProductId` matches the invulnerability product, call the `grantInvulnerability` function for the player. 

- Return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted` if successful, otherwise return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.NotProcessedYet`. 

### Step 5 - Set the Callback Function

- Set `MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt` to the `processReceipt` function to handle purchase processing. 

## Putting It All Together 🔧🔩 

- Start by getting the necessary services and setting up the Developer Product ID. 

- Define functions to handle invulnerability and receipt processing. 

- Set the callback function for processing receipts. 

**By following these simple steps, you can create a script that allows players to purchase invulnerability for their character, with the invulnerability lasting for a short duration before returning to normal.**
