## Objective üßêüóø

Creating a developer product in Roblox allows players to purchase in-game items, upgrades, or other features within your game.

## Steps to Create a Developer Product 

Follow these steps to create and monetize a developer product: 

### Step 1 - Prepare Your Experience

- Ensure your experience is published and accessible on the Roblox site. 

### Step 2 - Create the Product

- Go to your [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard) and select your experience. 

- In the **Monetization** menu, select **Developer Products** and click **Create a Developer Product**. 

- Optionally, upload an image (512√ó512 pixels in .jpg, .png, or .bmp format). 

- Fill in the **Name** and **Description** fields. 

- Set the price in Robux. 

- Click **Create**. 

### Step 3 - Integrate the Product in Your Game

- Open your game in Roblox Studio. 

- Use the following Lua script to add a purchase button for the developer product: 

```lua 
local Players = game:GetService("Players") 
local MarketplaceService = game:GetService("MarketplaceService") 
local productId = YOUR_PRODUCT_ID -- Replace with your developer product ID

local function onButtonClicked(player) 
    MarketplaceService:PromptProductPurchase(player, productId) 
end 

local function onPlayerAdded(player) 
    -- Assuming you have a ScreenGui with a TextButton in it 

    local playerGui = player:WaitForChild("PlayerGui") 
    local screenGui = playerGui:WaitForChild("ScreenGui") 
    local purchaseButton = screenGui:WaitForChild("PurchaseButton") 

    purchaseButton.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function() 
        onButtonClicked(player) 
    end) 
end 

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded) 
``` 

### Step 4 - Handle Purchase Events

- Add the following script to handle successful purchases: 

```lua 
local MarketplaceService = game:GetService("MarketplaceService") 
local Players = game:GetService("Players") 

local function onProductPurchase(receiptInfo) 
    local player = Players:GetPlayerByUserId(receiptInfo.PlayerId) 

    if not player then 
        return Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.NotProcessedYet 
    end 

    local productId = receiptInfo.ProductId 

    -- Handle the purchased product here 

    if productId == YOUR_PRODUCT_ID then 
        -- Grant the item or benefit to the player 
    end 

    return Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted 
end 

MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt = onProductPurchase 
``` 

### Step 5 - Test Your Product

- Use Roblox Studio's play mode to test the purchase functionality. 

- Make sure the purchase process works smoothly and the benefits are correctly granted to the player. 

### Step 6 - Publish Your Changes

- Once everything is tested and working, publish your game updates. 

- Your developer product is now live and ready for players to purchase. 

**By following these steps, you can successfully create and monetize a developer product in Roblox, enhancing your game's monetization strategy and providing additional value to your players.**
