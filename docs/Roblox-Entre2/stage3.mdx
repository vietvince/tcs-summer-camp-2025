## Objective üßêüóø

We are going to create a script that allows players to purchase a jump boost for their character in Roblox using a Developer Product.

## Description üìñü™∂ 

Here's what we want to accomplish: 

**1. Purchase Jump Boost:**

Players can buy a jump boost for their character using a Developer Product. 

**2. Increase Jump Power:**

When purchased, the character's jump power will double temporarily. 

**3. Restore Original Jump Power:**

After a short duration, the character's jump power will return to normal. 

**By doing this, we will create a dynamic gameplay feature where players can temporarily boost their character's jump power through in-game purchases.**

## Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö

### Step 1 - Get the Necessary Services

- Get the `MarketplaceService` from the game. 

- Get the `Players` service from the game. 

### Step 2 - Set Up Developer Product ID

- Define the Developer Product ID for the jump boost purchase (`DEV_PRODUCT_JUMP_BOOST`). 

### Step 3 - Create a Function to Handle Jump Boost

- Define a function named `grantJumpBoost` that takes a `player` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, get the player's character and its Humanoid component. 

- Store the original jump power of the Humanoid. 

- Double the Humanoid's jump power. 

- Wait for 5 seconds (the duration of the jump boost). 

- Reset the Humanoid's jump power to its original value. 

### Step 4 - Create a Function to Process Receipts

- Define a function named `processReceipt` that takes `receiptInfo` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, get the player from the receipt information. 

- If the player is not found, return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.NotProcessedYet`. 

- Use a `pcall` to handle any errors during processing. 

- If the `ProductId` matches the jump boost product, call the `grantJumpBoost` function for the player. 

- Return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted` if successful, otherwise return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.NotProcessedYet`. 

### Step 5 - Set the Callback Function

- Set `MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt` to the `processReceipt` function to handle purchase processing. 

## Putting It All Together üîßüî©

- Start by getting the necessary services and setting up the Developer Product ID. 

- Define functions to handle jump boost and receipt processing. 

- Set the callback function for processing receipts. 

**By following these simple steps, you can create a script that allows players to purchase a jump boost for their character, with the jump power returning to normal after a short duration.**
