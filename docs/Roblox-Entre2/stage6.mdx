## Objective 🧐🗿

We are going to create a script that teleports a player a small distance in Roblox.

## Description 📖🪶

We are going to create a script that teleports a player a small distance in Roblox. Here's what we want to accomplish:

**1. Check Player Character:**

Ensure the player has a character and a humanoid root part. 

**2. Teleport Player:**

Move the player's character by a small distance in the Z direction. 

**By doing this, we can create a function that teleports a player slightly forward.** 

## Instructions and Code Logic 📝📚

### Step 1 - Create a Function to Teleport Players

- Define a function named `smallTeleport` that takes a `player` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, check if the player has a character and a `HumanoidRootPart`. 

- If the player has a `HumanoidRootPart`, create a new CFrame offset by -10 units in the Z direction. 

- Update the `HumanoidRootPart`'s CFrame to teleport the player. 

- If the player does not have a valid character or `HumanoidRootPart`, display a warning message. 

## Putting It All Together 🔧🔩 

- Define the `smallTeleport` function to handle the logic of teleporting the player a small distance forward. 

- Inside the function, check if the player has a character and a `HumanoidRootPart`. 

- If valid, update the player's CFrame to teleport them. 

- Display appropriate warning messages for any issues encountered. 

**By following these simple steps, you can create a script that teleports a player a small distance forward.**
