## Objective 🧐🗿

We are going to create a script that allows players to skip to the next level in Roblox by changing their team.

## Description 📖🪶

Here's what we want to accomplish:

**1. Identify Current Team:**

Check the player's current team. 

**2. Extract Level Number:**

Get the current level number from the team's name. 

**3. Increment Level:**

Move the player to the next level's team. 

**4. Respawn Player:**

Reset the player's character to reflect the team change. 

**By doing this, the player will be able to progress to the next level by switching to the appropriate team.** 

## Instructions and Code Logic 📝📚

### Step 1 - Set Up Services and Teams

- Get the `Teams` service from the game. 

- Get the `Players` service from the game. 

- Get the player's current team. 

### Step 2 - Create a Function to Skip Levels

- Define a function named `SkipLevel` that takes a `player` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, check if the player has a team assigned. 

- If the player has a team, extract the current level number from the team's name. 

- Increment the level number to determine the next level. 

- Find the next team by name. 

- If the next team exists, assign the player to the next team and reset the player's character. 

- If the next team does not exist, display a warning message. 

- If the current team's name does not contain a level number, display a warning message. 

- If the player does not have a team assigned, display a warning message. 

## Putting It All Together 🔧🔩

- Start by setting up the services and getting the player's current team. 

- Define the `SkipLevel` function to handle the logic of moving the player to the next level. 

- Inside the function, check if the player has a team, extract the level number, and find the next team. 

- If the next team is found, move the player to the next team and reset the player's character. 

- Display appropriate warning messages for any issues encountered. 

**By following these simple steps, you can create a script that allows players to skip to the next level by changing their team.**
