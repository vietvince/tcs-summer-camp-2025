## Objective üßêüóø

We are going to create a script that allows players to purchase a size increase for their character in Roblox using a Developer Product.

## Description üìñü™∂ 

Here's what we want to accomplish: 

**1. Purchase Size Increase:**

Players can buy a size increase for their character using a Developer Product. 

**2. Increase Character Size:**

When purchased, the character's size will increase temporarily. 

**3. Restore Original Size:**

After a short duration, the character's size will return to normal. 

**By doing this, we will create a dynamic gameplay feature where players can temporarily grow their character's size through in-game purchases.** 

## Instructions and Code Logic üìùüìö

### Step 1 - Get the Necessary Services

- Get the `MarketplaceService` from the game. 

- Get the `Players` service from the game. 

### Step 2 - Set Up Developer Product ID

- Define the Developer Product ID for the size increase purchase (`DEV_PRODUCT_SIZE_INCREASE`). 

### Step 3 - Create a Function to Handle Size Increase

- Define a function named `grantSizeIncrease` that takes a `player` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, get the player's character. 

- Store the original scales of the character's body parts. 

- Increase the scales of the body parts to double their original size. 

- Wait for 5 seconds (the duration of the size increase). 

- Reset the scales of the body parts to their original sizes. 

### Step 4 - Create a Function to Process Receipts

- Define a function named `processReceipt` that takes `receiptInfo` as an argument. 

- Inside the function, get the player from the receipt information. 

- If the player is not found, return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.NotProcessedYet`. 

- Use a `pcall` to handle any errors during processing. 

- If the `ProductId` matches the size increase product, call the `grantSizeIncrease` function for the player. 

- Return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted` if successful, otherwise return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.NotProcessedYet`. 

### Step 5 - Set the Callback Function

- Set `MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt` to the `processReceipt` function to handle purchase processing. 

## Putting It All Together üîßüî©

- Start by getting the necessary services and setting up the Developer Product ID. 

- Define functions to handle size increase and receipt processing. 

- Set the callback function for processing receipts. 

**By following these simple steps, you can create a script that allows players to purchase a size increase for their character, with the size returning to normal after a short duration.**
