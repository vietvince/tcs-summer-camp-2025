# Stage 5: Zombie Aggression

## Objective üßêüóø

In this session, we're adding a twist to our game by allowing zombies to attack and potentially destroy the plants if they get too close. Prepare for a battle where plants must defend against the undead!

It is not fair that only plants get to do damage to zombies. The zombies will now fight back and eat the plants as well if they get too close! (muhahahahaha)

## Step 1 - Zombie Attacks and Danger üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1.1 - Edit the Original Zombie Script

We're enhancing our zombies with new capabilities including attack damage and range. Let‚Äôs dive into the zombie script and start coding!

**üìù Zombie Script Pseudocode:**

```csharp
Zombie Class:
   Declare variables:
     - attackDamage: an integer for the damage the zombie will cause
     - health: an integer for the health of the zombie
     - range: a float defining how far the zombie can detect plants
     - target: a GameObject that will store the currently detected plant

   Start method:
     - Set 'target' to null initially

   Update method:
     - Perform a raycast within 'range' to detect plants
     - If a plant is within range, set 'target' to the plant

   OnTriggerStay2D method:
     - Check if the target is a plant
     - If true, reduce the plant's health by 'attackDamage' every second

```
### 1.2 - Testing Zombie Interactions:

Place a plant next to a zombie and observe:

  - The plant should lose health and potentially die, demonstrating the zombie's attack capabilities.


### 1.3 - Next steps

Now we have a basic combat system between plants and zombies! Now it is up to you to make your game cool with:
- UIs
- Plants
- Zombies.

Don't forget to revisit your scripts if you want certain properties to be changed.

For example: "The zombie does too much damage, it is too OP!!!". You can easily change the data number by visiting the zombie object and giving it a new value.

    <summary><strong>Medium: Add Zombie Animation</strong></summary>

**Goal: Implement interactive behaviors for the sun and sunflower.**

    **2.1 Gather your assets**

    Search online for zombie animation sprites. Choose a sprite sheet with various frames that depict different stages of movement or attack.

    **2.2 Editing the sheet**

    Open the sprite editor in Unity and slice the sprite sheet to separate each frame. Ensure each frame is isolated for individual animations.

    **2.3 Animate**

    Utilize Unity's animation editor to compile the frames into a coherent animation. Drag the frames into the animation timeline and adjust the sequence and timing until the zombie's movements look natural and engaging.

    <summary><strong>Hard: Dynamic Zombie Behaviors and Types</strong></summary>

**Goal: Enhance zombie mechanics for advanced gameplay.**
- **Zombie Health Randomizer**: Make the zombie health random between different zombies to confuse the plants! 

- **Zombie Limitations**: Set the maximum number of zombies that are in the game. 

- **Multiple types of zombies**: Add conehead, buckethead, or whichever zombie type you like into your game!
