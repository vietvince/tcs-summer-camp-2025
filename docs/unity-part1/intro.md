## What You're Signing Up For ✍️✅

- **Design a Classic**:  Step into the shoes of a game designer and layout your own Plants vs. Zombies-style tower defense game.
- **Interact and React**: Make your game respond to your every command, balancing the challenge to keep it fun and engaging.
- **Control the Game**: Dive into creating a game loop that keeps your game running smoothly, ensuring every plant action and zombie movement is seamless.
