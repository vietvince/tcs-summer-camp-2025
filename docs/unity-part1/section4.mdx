# Stage 4: Sun and Sunflowers

## Objective 🧐🗿

In this lesson, we're going to illuminate our game world by making suns drop from the sky and sunflowers generate suns. Before we start, let's create a plant script for both the peashooter and the upcoming sunflower.

## Step 1 - Set Up the Plant Script 🌳📜

### 1.1 Implement the Code

**📝 Pseudocode for Plant Script:**

```csharp
Plant Class:
   Declare variables:
     - health: an integer to store the health of the plant
     - tile: a Transform indicating the tile where the plant is placed

   Start method:
     - Set the layer of the gameObject to 9 (or another specified layer for interaction within Unity)

```

Ensure each plant in Unity has an assigned health value.

## Step 2 - Sun Drops and Sunflowers 🌞🌻

### 2.1 Implement the Code

Create a new object for the sun:

- Components: Sprite Renderer, Box Collider 2D, Sun Script

- Sprite: Choose an image that looks sunny!

**📝 Sun Script Pseudocode:**

```csharp
SunScript Class:
   Declare variables:
     - dropDownPosition: a float indicating the y-coordinate to which the sun should drop
     - speed: a float set to 1.4f to control the movement speed of the sun
     - targetPosition: a Vector3 to store the target position where the sun should stop
     - hasReachedTarget: a boolean to track whether the sun has reached its target position

   Start method:
     - Set targetPosition based on the current x and z positions of the sun but use dropDownPosition for the y-coordinate
     - Destroy the gameObject after a random time between 9 and 15 seconds

   Update method:
     - If the sun has not yet reached the target position:
         - Move the sun towards the target position at a rate of 'speed * Time.deltaTime'
         - Check if the distance between the current position and target position is less than 0.01
             - If true, set 'hasReachedTarget' to true indicating the sun has stopped moving

```
## Step 3 - Create the SunSpawner 🌞📦

### 3.1 Implement the Code

Place a SunSpawner object above the lawn:

**📝 Sun Spawner Pseudocode:**

```csharp
SunSpawner Class:
   Declare variables:
     - sunObject: a GameObject reference for the sun object to be spawned

   Start method:
     - Schedule the SpawnSun method to be called after a random delay between 3 and 9 seconds

   SpawnSun method:
     - Instantiate a new sunObject at a random x-coordinate between -4.71 and 6.9, y-coordinate fixed at 6, and z-coordinate fixed at 0 with no rotation (Quaternion.identity)
     - Set the dropDownPosition of the instantiated sun to a random y-coordinate between 2 and -3
     - Schedule the SpawnSun method to be called again after a random delay between 3 and 9 seconds

```

## Step 4 - Edit the GameManager 🎮👨‍💼

### 4.1 Implement the Code

Modify the GameManager to collect suns using a raycast and mouse interaction.

**📝 GameManager Pseudocode:**

Modify the GameManager to collect suns using a raycast and mouse interaction.

```csharp

Update method:
   - Check if the left mouse button is pressed
   - Create a ray from the camera through the mouse position
   - Perform a raycast in 2D to detect if any object with a specific mask (sunMask) is hit
   - If an object is hit by the raycast:
       - Increase the suns counter by 25 (presumably, suns act as a resource or score)
       - Destroy the object that was hit (removing the sun from the scene)
```

## Step 5 - Create the Sunflower 🌻📦

### 5.1 Implement the Code

Duplicate the peashooter object, replace its sprite with a sunflower, and modify the script for sun production.

**📝 Sun Script Pseudocode:**

```csharp
SunFlower Class:
   Declare variables:
     - sunObject: a GameObject reference for the sun object to be spawned
     - cooldown: a float representing the time between spawns

   Start method:
     - Schedule the SpawnSun method to be called repeatedly every 'cooldown' seconds starting after the first 'cooldown' period

   SpawnSun method:
     - Calculate the drop position to be half a unit below the current y-coordinate of the SunFlower
     - Instantiate a new sunObject at the calculated position with no rotation (Quaternion.identity)


```

    <summary><strong>Medium: Add Sunflower Animation</strong></summary>

**Goal: Implement interactive behaviors for the sun and sunflower.**

    **6.1 Gather your assets**

    Search online for sunflower assets to animate! Preferably a sunflower sheet with a different image for each frame. 

    **6.2 Editing the sheet**

    Use the sprite editor and slice the sheet file, then replace the existing sunflower object's sprite with the sunflower sheet. 

    **6.3 Animate**

    Use the animation editor to create an animation! Simply drag the images onto the editor and click play until the animation looks right.

    <summary><strong>Hard: Dynamic Sunflower Behaviors</strong></summary>

**Goal: Enhance sunflower mechanics for advanced gameplay.**

- **Variable Sun Production**: Make sun production rates vary based on the time of day in-game. Sunflowers produce more frequently when it is first planted and gradually the production speed decreases or increases.
- **Sunflower Limitations**: Set the maximum number of sunflowers that are allowed to be planted to make the user think twice before spam buying sunflowers.

- [x] **Ensure both the sunflower and the peashooter are functioning correctly before moving on. In the next session, we'll focus on enabling zombies to attack our plants.**
