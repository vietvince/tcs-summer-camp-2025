## Objective üßêüóø

Learn to set up the game environment and introduce basic zombie mechanics, creating a foundation for further development in Unity.


## Step 1 - Set Up the Environment üåçüå±

### 1.1 Unity Interface and Camera Movement

First, ensure you are operating in a 2D game environment. Go to **Edit > Project Settings > Editor** and enable **Enter Play Mode Options** for efficient testing.

Familiarize yourself with key areas of the Unity Editor:

- **Scene View**: Build and modify your game space.
- **Game View**: Preview the game as you develop.
- **Inspector**: Adjust settings and properties of selected game elements.

**Navigation Tips**:
- Rotate the scene with the right mouse button.
- Pan using the middle mouse button or holding `Alt` + left mouse button.
- Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.

Adjust the camera to cover the main gameplay area. This setting is crucial as it determines what the player sees.

### 1.2 Background

**Background**: Obtain a vibrant garden image for the game‚Äôs backdrop. Consider creating one in a graphic design tool or finding a suitable royalty-free image online. For this tutorial, we‚Äôll use a default garden setting reminiscent of classic defense games.

## Step 2 - Set up the Objects üì¶üîß

### 2.1 Create Zombie Images

**Zombie Sprite**:
- Create or find a zombie sprite. If drawing, use graphic software or a sprite creation tool. Alternatively, download from free resources online.
- Ensure you have multiple frames for future animation.

### 2.2 Create Basic Zombie Object

**Setup**:
- In Unity, create a new Sprite object in your scene and name it 'Zombie'.

**Sprite Renderer**:
- Attach your zombie sprite using the Sprite Renderer component to visualize the zombie in your game.

**Transforms**:
- Position your zombie to fit the scene appropriately. Adjust scale and rotation if necessary.

## Step 3 - Set up the Zombie Script üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìú

### 3.1 Script Basic Zombie Movement

Create a script named `ZombieMovement` to define basic behaviors:

```csharp
ZombieMovement Class:
   Declare variables:
     - speed: a float for the movement speed of the zombie

   Update method:
     - Move the zombie to the left by multiplying 'speed' with Time.deltaTime and subtracting from the current position along the x-axis
```
This script moves the zombie leftward across the screen. Ensure you understand the code, if not ask your coach for a cup of water; I mean for help. 

### 3.2 Create Zombie Spawners

Spawner Object:

Place an empty GameObject named 'ZombieSpawner' on the edge of your screen.

Spawner Script:
Develop a script to spawn zombies at regular intervals. 

Follow this guide:

```csharp
ZombieSpawner Class:
   Declare variables:
     - spawnpoints: an array of Transform objects where zombies can spawn
     - zombie: a GameObject reference for the zombie prefab

   Start method:
     - Schedule the SpawnZombie method to be called every 2 seconds starting after a 2-second delay

   SpawnZombie method:
     - Choose a random index from the spawnpoints array
     - Instantiate a zombie at the selected spawnpoint's position with no rotation (Quaternion.identity)

```

Tip:
If you find the interface unfamiliar or challenging, take extra time to experiment. Add various objects, explore different settings, and observe their effects in the Game View. Familiarity now will make advanced lessons more accessible.

    <summary><strong>Medium: Add reverse zombies.</strong></summary>

**Goal: Add reverse zombies that go from right to left.**

    **4.1 Duplicate Your Existing Zombie**

        Copy your existing zombie GameObjects in Unity to create counterparts that will move in the opposite direction.

    **4.2 Modify the move script**

        Make it go on the other direction. (HMMMMMM)

    <summary><strong>Hard: Add sound effect to zombie</strong></summary>

**Goal: Add sound effects when a zombie is on the lawn.**

    **5.1 Add sound to the zombie object**

        As a pro Unity developer, we must add some sounds to our zombies, our ears need to know when there is a zombie apocalypse. 

    **5.2 Add sound events**

        Make sounds play when a certain event happens, like when a zombie spawns.
