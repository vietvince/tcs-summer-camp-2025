Hello there fellow Unity learners! For the setup, spend 30 minutes or so explore the Unity game engine as a whole:

- Add some objects in it and play around in the scene area. 
- The camera system might be a little weird at first, but you will become a professional at it in no time. 

## Description üìùü§ì

In this course, you can apply the logic on other objects, not just plants and zombies.

Unity 2D has a lot of free assets you can download and play around with. Search for it in the Unity website!

Although this is a Plants vs. Zombies based game, nothing is stopping you in making something like Hamburger vs. Pizza or Cars vs. Trucks, the possibilities are endless.

We all look forward to see what you are gonna cook up for us!
