## What is VR?

Virtual Reality (VR) is like a magic trick that lets you step inside a whole new world! You put on a special headset and suddenly you're exploring, playing, and creating in a fantastical place!

Imagine being a superhero, flying through the air, or exploring a mysterious jungle temple. With VR, you can do all that and more! It's like being inside a video game, but it feels super real!

## How this Tutorial is Designed

Get ready for 10 stages of coding fun, all designed in Obby style! Each stage offers three different difficulty options, representing how hard to make and play the stage, and you get to choose the challenge stage that suits you best!
