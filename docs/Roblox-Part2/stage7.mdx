    <summary>**Hard: Hold onto your hats as we add moving cover for extra chaos!**</summary>

    **If you want more of a challenge by recreating the video yourself, follow these steps:**

    For those seeking an extra challenge in Stage 7's rolling rocks chaos, get ready to up the ante with some moving cover madness! Here's how to take it to the next stage:
 
    **Description**

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox move back and forth smoothly using tweens. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Set Up Movement:**
    
    The part will start at its initial position and move to a new position 10 studs away. 

    **Step 2 - Smooth Movement:**
    
    The part will move smoothly using a tween, taking 2 seconds for each movement. 

    **Step 3 - Repeat Movement:**
    
    The part will keep moving back and forth forever. 

    By doing this, the part will continuously move back and forth, creating a smooth animation effect. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Get the `TweenService` from the game. 

    - Create a variable for the starting position of the part (`startPos`). 

    - Create a variable for the ending position 10 studs away from the starting position (`endPos`). 

    - Create a `TweenInfo` object that defines how the tween will behave: 

        - Duration: 2 seconds. 

        - Easing style: Linear (smooth and consistent speed). 

        - Easing direction: Out (slows down at the end). 

        - Repeat count: -1 (infinite repeats). 

        - Reverses: true (moves back and forth). 

        - Delay time: 0 seconds (no delay). 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function:** 

    - Define a function named `startTween`. 

    - Inside the function, create a tween that moves the part from `startPos` to `endPos`. 

    - Connect a function to the tween's `Completed` event to swap `startPos` and `endPos` when the tween finishes, and then restart the tween. 

    - Start the tween by calling the `Play` method. 

    - Call the `startTween` function to begin the movement. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your part, tween service, and positions. 

    - Create a `TweenInfo` object to define the tween behavior. 

    - Define a function named `startTween` to create and manage the tween. 

    - Inside the function, create a tween to move the part and handle the completion event. 

    - Start the tween to begin the movement. 

    - Call the `startTween` function to kick off the process.

    **Extra Points Challenge:**

    Gear up for the ultimate test! Duplicate and apply this code across all your boulders. Then, push your boundaries and showcase your mastery of the rolling rock chaos. Are you prepared to triumph, earning the recognition of your fellow adventurers and the admiration of your Code Coach?

    Remember, while this challenge may be tough, don't hesitate to seek guidance from your Code Coach if needed. But if you can conquer this feat solo, you'll earn some serious coding accolades!
    
    So, gear up, intrepid coders, and brace yourselves for the moving cover mayhem of **Stage 7 - Hard**! Let's roll! üöÄüíª */}
