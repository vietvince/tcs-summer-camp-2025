    **Description**

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox move side to side between two points. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Start at a Position:**
    
    The part will start at a certain position. 

    **Step 2 - Move Side to Side:**
    
    The part will move to one side up to a set distance, then move back to the starting position, and keep repeating this movement. 

    **Step 3- Direction Change:**
    
    When the part reaches the set distance on one side, it will change direction and move back to the starting position. 

    **Step 4 - Smooth Movement:**
    
    The part will move smoothly using a tweening effect, pausing for a short time between movements. 

    By doing this, the part will continuously move side to side in a loop, creating a smooth and continuous animation effect. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**
    
    **Step 1 - Set Up Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable to hold the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Create a variable for how fast the part will move (`speed`). 

    - Create a variable for how far the part will move (`distance`). 

    - Make a variable to remember the starting position of the part. 

    - Create a variable to set the direction of movement using a vector (`direction`). 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function:**

    - Define a function named `moveSideToSide` to hold the moving logic. 

    **Step 3 - Make an Infinite Loop:**

    - Inside the function, use a loop that runs forever. In Lua, this is done with `while true do`. 

    **Step 4 - Calculate Goal Position:**

    - Calculate the position where the part should move by adding the `direction` multiplied by the `distance` to the starting position (`startPos`). 

    **Step 5 - Calculate Distance and Time:**

    - Calculate the distance from the current position to the goal position. 

    - Calculate the time it should take to move to the goal position by dividing the distance by the speed. 

    **Step 6 - Create a Tween:**

    - Create a `TweenInfo` object with the calculated time and set the easing style to `Linear`. 

    - Use the `TweenService` to create a tween that moves the part to the goal position. 

    **Step 7 - Play the Tween:**

    - Play the tween and wait for it to complete. 

    **Step 8 - Change Direction:**

    - After reaching the goal position, change the direction to the opposite by multiplying the `direction` by -1. 

    **Step 9 - Pause the Loop:** 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time, such as 1 second, before repeating the loop. 

    **Step 10 - Call the Function:**

    - Outside the function, call `moveSideToSide` to start the movement. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your starting variables. 

    - Define a function named `moveSideToSide` to hold the moving logic. 

    - Inside the function, create an infinite loop using `while true do`. 

    - Calculate the goal position by adding the `direction` multiplied by the `distance` to the starting position. 

    - Calculate the distance to the goal position and the time it should take to move there. 

    - Create a `TweenInfo` object with the calculated time and set the easing style to `Linear`. 

    - Use the `TweenService` to create a tween that moves the part to the goal position. 

    - Play the tween and wait for it to complete. 

    - Change the direction to the opposite by multiplying the `direction` by -1. 

    - Use the `wait` function to pause the loop for a short time. 

    - Outside the function, call `moveSideToSide` to start the movement.
