    <summary>**Hard: Mysterious mines that reveal their presence with a bang!**</summary>

    **If you want more of a challenge by recreating the video yourself, follow these steps:**

    Welcome, brave adventurers, to the heart-pounding challenge of Stage 6 - where mysterious mines lie hidden, waiting to reveal themselves with a bang! Are you ready to test your wits and courage in this perilous terrain?

    **Description** 

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox explode when it gets touched. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Detect Touch:**
    
    The script will detect when the part is touched. 

    **Step 2 - Create an Explosion:**
    
    When the part is touched, it will create an explosion at the part's position. 

    **Step 3 - Change Part Appearance:**
    
    The part will become fully visible when it explodes. 

    By doing this, we will create an exciting effect where the part explodes and becomes visible when touched. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic** 

    **Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables**: 

    - Create a variable to hold the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function**

    - Connect a function to the part's `Touched` event to detect when the part is touched. 

    - Inside the function, create a new explosion. 

    - Set the explosion's parent to `workspace` so it appears in the game. 

    - Set the explosion's position to the part's position. 

    - Set the explosion's blast radius to 50. 

    - Make the part fully visible by setting its `Transparency` to 0. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your part variable. 

    - Connect a function to the part's `Touched` event to detect touches. 

    - Inside the function, create a new explosion and set its properties. 

    - Make the part fully visible when it is touched.
