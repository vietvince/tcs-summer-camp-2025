    Ready to tackle the ultimate challenge? Let‚Äôs dive into the mind-bending adventure of Stage 10: Puzzle Room! Prepare to push your limits as you solve clever puzzles and unlock the secrets of this tricky room. Are you up for the challenge?    

    **Description**

    We are going to create a script that makes buttons in Roblox follow a specific order. When the buttons are pressed in the correct order, a wall will be destroyed. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Define Button Order:**
    
    The script will have a specific order in which buttons need to be pressed. 

    **Step 2 - Check Button Presses:**
    
    The script will check if the buttons are pressed in the correct order. 

    **Step 3 - Play Sounds:**
    
    The script will play a sound when the correct or incorrect button is pressed. 

    **Step 4 - Destroy Wall:**
    
    When all buttons are pressed in the correct order, a wall will be destroyed, and the buttons will be removed. 

    By doing this, we will create a fun challenge for players to press the buttons in the correct order to destroy the wall. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the order of button colors (`buttonOrder`). 

    - Create a variable to keep track of the current button index (`currentButtonIndex`). 

    - Create variables for the red, green, and blue buttons by setting them to their respective parents (`redButton`, `greenButton`, `blueButton`). 

    - Create a table to store references to all the buttons (`buttons`). 

    - Create variables for the correct and incorrect sounds (`correctSound`, `incorrectSound`). 

    **Step 2 - Create the Functions:**

    - Define a function named `checkButtonOrder` that takes a `buttonPressed` argument. 

    - Inside the function, check if the `buttonPressed` matches the current button in the order. 

    - If correct, play the correct sound and move to the next button in the order. 

    - If all buttons are pressed correctly, destroy the wall and remove the buttons. 

    - If incorrect, reset the button index and play the incorrect sound. 

    - Define a function named `buttonClicked` that takes a `color` argument. 

    - Return a function that calls `checkButtonOrder` with the given color. 

    - Connect the `buttonClicked` function to each button's `MouseClick` event, passing the respective color. 

    <br  />
    
    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your button order, index, buttons, and sounds. 

    - Define a function named `checkButtonOrder` to handle checking the button presses. 

    - Define a function named `buttonClicked` to handle button clicks. 

    - Connect the `buttonClicked` function to each button's `MouseClick` event. 

    {/* <br  />

    Prepare yourself for the ultimate challenge! Change up the Scripts across all your spinning kill bricks. Then, test your limits and demonstrate your expertise in navigating through the spinning chaos. Are you ready to emerge victorious, earning the respect of your fellow adventurers and the admiration of your Code Coach?
