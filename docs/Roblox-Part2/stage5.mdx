    **If you want more of a challenge by recreating the video yourself, follow these steps:**

    Welcome to Stage 5: Fireball Footpath, where things are heating up as we crank up the challenge! Get ready to feel the burn as we dial up the fireball frequency and size! Are you prepared to brave the flames and emerge victorious?

    **Description** 

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox shoot fireballs. The fireballs will be created at random times, move in a straight line, and explode when they touch a player. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Create Fireballs:**
    
    The script will create new fireballs at random intervals. 

    **Step 2 - Move Fireballs:**
    
    Each fireball will move forward at a random speed. 

    **Step 3 - Explode on Touch:**
    
    If a fireball touches a player, it will explode and disappear. 

    **Step 4 - Remove Fireballs After Time:**
    
    Fireballs will automatically be removed after a short time if they don't touch anything. 

    By doing this, we will create an exciting effect where fireballs are continuously shot from a part, creating dynamic gameplay. 

    <br  />
    
    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Get the `ServerStorage` and `Players` services from the game. 

    - Get the `Debris` service from the game to help remove items. 

    - Create a variable for the speed of the fireballs with a random value between 10 and 20. 

    - Create a variable for the time after which the fireballs will be removed (`removalTime`). 

    - Create a variable for the time between each fireball spawn with a random value between 1 and 5 (`spawnTime`). 

    - Create a variable for the color of the fireballs (`myBrickColor`). 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function:** 

    - Define a function named `createFireBall` to handle making new fireballs. 

    - Inside the function, create a new part and set it up to look like a fireball. 

    - Set the fireball's size to a random value between 2 and 5. 

    - Make the fireball's color neon red. 

    - Add a `BodyVelocity` to the fireball to make it move forward. 

    **Step 3 - Set Fireball Movement:**

    - Set the velocity of the fireball to make it move in the direction the part is facing, multiplied by the speed. 

    **Step 4 - Set Fireball Position:**

    - Set the position of the fireball to be just in front of the part. 

    **Step 5 - Handle Fireball Touch:**

    - Connect a function to the fireball's `Touched` event to check if it hits a player. 

    - If the fireball touches a player, create an explosion at the fireball's position and destroy the fireball. 

    **Step 6 - Remove Fireballs After Time:**

    - Use the `Debris` service to remove the fireball after the `removalTime`. 

    **Step 7 - Create Fireballs Continuously:**

    - Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, call the `createFireBall` function to make a new fireball. 

    - Pause the loop for the `spawnTime` before creating the next fireball. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your part, services, and fireball properties. 

    - Define a function named `createFireBall` to handle making new fireballs. 

    - Inside the function, create a new fireball and set its properties. 

    - Set the fireball to move forward and check for player touches to cause explosions. 

    - Use the `Debris` service to remove fireballs after a short time. 

    - Create an infinite loop to keep making new fireballs at random intervals.
