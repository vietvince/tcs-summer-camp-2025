    <summary>**Hard: Make the doorways flicker on and off to add an exciting twist!**</summary>

    **If you want more of a challenge by recreating the video yourself, follow these steps:**

    Let's raise the stakes in Stage 9 by adding a thrilling twist to our doorways - they'll flicker on and off, adding an extra layer of excitement to our adventure!

    **Description** 

    We are going to create a script that makes a part in Roblox change its color and whether it can be collided with or not. Here's what we want to accomplish: 

    **Step 1 - Change Color:**
    
    The part will switch between green and red. 

    **Step 2 - Toggle Collision:**
    
    The part will change whether it can be collided with or not when it changes color. 

    **Step 3 - Repeat Continuously:**
    
    The part will keep changing color and collision status in a loop. 

    By doing this, the part will keep switching colors and collision states, creating an interesting effect. 

    <br  />

    **Instructions and Code Logic**

    **Step 1 - Set Up the Starting Variables:**

    - Create a variable for the part by setting it to the `Parent` of the script. 

    - Create a variable for the green color. 

    - Create a variable for the red color. 

    - Create a variable for the delay between swaps (`swapDelay`). 

    **Step 2 - Create a Function:**

    - Define a function named `swapColor`. 

    - Inside the function, change the part's color to green and set `CanCollide` to false. 

    - Pause the function for the `swapDelay`. 

    - Change the part's color to red and set `CanCollide` to true. 

    - Pause the function for the `swapDelay`. 

    **Step 3 - Create an Infinite Loop:**

    - Create a loop that runs forever using `while true do`. 

    - Inside the loop, call the `swapColor` function to keep swapping the part's color and collision status. 

    <br  />

    **Putting It All Together**

    - Start by setting up your part and color variables. 

    - Define a function named `swapColor` to change the part's color and collision status. 

    - Inside the function, switch the part's color and collision state and pause for the `swapDelay`. 

    - Create an infinite loop using `while true do` to keep calling the `swapColor` function.
