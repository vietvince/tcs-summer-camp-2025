## Objective üßê

Script your **Dot** sprite to:

- Initialize and display the player‚Äôs score.  
- Animate through its costumes continuously.  
- Move in response to arrow-key presses.  
- Bounce off the stage edges to stay in play.

## Code Blocks üß±
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    set [score v] to (0)
    say [Help me catch the star!] for (2) seconds
    forever
        switch costume to [dot-a v]
        wait (0.1) seconds
        switch costume to [dot-b v]
        wait (0.1) seconds
        switch costume to [dot-c v]
        wait (0.1) seconds
    end

when [right arrow v] key pressed
    point in direction (90)
    move (10) steps
    if on edge, bounce

when [left arrow v] key pressed
    point in direction (-90)
    move (10) steps
    if on edge, bounce

when [up arrow v] key pressed
    point in direction (0)
    move (10) steps
    if on edge, bounce

when [down arrow v] key pressed
    point in direction (180)
    move (10) steps
    if on edge, bounce
```
- Score resets to 0 and the Dot prompts the player at the start.

- The Dot continuously cycles through its three costumes for a simple animation.

- Arrow keys move the Dot in all four directions, with bounce logic to keep it on screen.

- [x] Fantastic! Your Dot is now animated and responsive. Up next: Star Chase 3 ‚Äì Star, where we‚Äôll script the collectible stars!
