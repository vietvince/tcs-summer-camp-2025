## Code Blocks üß±
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    show
    set size to (50) %
    repeat (5)
        create clone of (myself)
    end
    hide

when I start as a clone
    go to x: (240) y: (pick random (-150) to (150))
    set [speed v] to (pick random (-6) to (-2))
    repeat until <touching [Rocketship v]?>
        change x by (speed)
        if <(x position) < (-220)> then
            go to x: (240) y: (pick random (-150) to (150))
        end
        if <touching [Laser v]?> then
            change [score v] by (100)
            go to x: (240) y: (pick random (-150) to (150))
            start sound [Magic Spell v]
        end
    end
    broadcast [Game Over v]

when I receive [Game Over v]
    stop [other scripts in sprite v]
```
- On green flag, the Rock sprite creates 5 clones, then hides itself.

- Each clone spawns at x=240 with a random y and speed, moves left until it either goes off-screen or collides.

- If a clone‚Äôs x position < ‚Äì220, it resets to the right at a new random y.

- If a clone touches a Laser, the score increases by 100, the clone resets, and plays a sound.

- When a clone eventually touches the Rocketship, it broadcasts Game Over.

- On receiving Game Over, all remaining Rock scripts stop.

<br />

- [x] Nicely done! Your asteroids are now in play. Next up: Space Shooter 5 ‚Äì Game Over!
