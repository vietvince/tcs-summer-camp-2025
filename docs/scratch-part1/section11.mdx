## Objective 🧐

Create an **Image Classification** model that recognizes each planet and displays a fun fact when it sees it.

## Getting Started with Image Project 🚩

### Step 1. Create a New Image Project  
1. Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com).  
2. Click **Get Started** → **Image Project** → **Standard Image Model**.

### Step 2. Define Planet Classes  
1. Rename **Class 1** → **Mercury**  
2. **Class 2** → **Venus**  
3. **Class 3** → **Earth**  
4. **Class 4** → **Mars**  
*(Optional: add more classes for Jupiter, etc.)*

### Step 3. Upload Training Images  
1. For each planet, click **Upload** → select 10–20 clear photos or drawings of that planet.  
2. Use simple, uncluttered backgrounds to help the model learn.

### Step 4. Train Your Model  
1. Click **Train Model** at the bottom.  
2. Wait for training to complete (a minute or two).

### Step 5. Prepare Your Fun Facts  
1. Write a short fun fact for each planet (e.g., “Earth is the only planet with liquid water!”).  
2. Save them in a text file or spreadsheet.

### Step 6. Test & Tour  
1. Switch to the **Preview** tab.  
2. Hold up a printed planet image or toy model to the camera.  
3. When the model predicts “Mars,” display or read:  
   > **Mars is red because its soil is full of iron oxide!**

### Step 7. Export & Share  
1. Click **Export Model** → **Download** (TensorFlow.js).  
2. Embed your model in a simple web page that shows the predicted planet name and its fun fact.
