## Objective üßê

Program the Laser sprite so that pressing the spacebar fires a laser clone from the Rocketship‚Äôs position, sending it across the stage until it disappears.

## Code Blocks üß±
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    set size to (10) %
    hide

when [space v] key pressed
    create clone of (myself)

when I start as a clone
    go to x: (-160) y: (y position of [Rocketship v])
    show
    repeat until <touching [edge v]?>
        move (10) steps
    end
    delete this clone

when I receive [Game Over v]
    stop [other scripts in sprite v]
```
- The Laser is initially hidden and scaled down to 10% so it‚Äôs ready to clone.

- Pressing space creates a clone at x = ‚Äì160, aligned vertically with the Rocketship.

- Each clone shows, moves 10 steps per frame until it hits the edge, then deletes itself.

- On Game Over, any running Laser scripts halt immediately.

<br />

- [x] Great shot! Your Laser now fires cleanly from the Rocketship. Up next: Lesson 4 ‚Äì Rocks!
