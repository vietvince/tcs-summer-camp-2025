## Objective üßê

Script your Rocketship to track score, move up and down with the arrow keys, implement a countdown timer, and respond to the Game Over broadcast.

## Code Blocks üß±
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    set [score v] to (0)
    set size to (50) %
    go to x: (-178) y: (5)
    repeat until <touching [Rock v]?>
        if <key [up arrow v] pressed?> then
            change y by (10)
        end
        if <key [down arrow v] pressed?> then
            change y by (-10)
        end
    end

when green flag clicked
    set [time v] to (30)
    repeat (30)
        wait (1) seconds
        change [time v] by (-1)
    end
    stop [all v]

when I receive [Game Over v]
    stop [other scripts in sprite v]
```
- Score starts at 0 and the ship is sized/positioned for play.

- Movement continues until a collision with a Rock ends the loop.

- A time variable counts down from 30, then stops all scripts when it reaches 0.

- Upon receiving Game Over, the Rocketship halts any remaining scripts.

<br />

- [x] **Great work!** Your Rocketship now moves, tracks score, runs a timer, and listens for the Game Over broadcast. Up next: **Lesson 3 ‚Äì Laser**!
