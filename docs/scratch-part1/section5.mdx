    <summary>**Prerequisites: Before You Dive In!**</summary>

- You have completed **Setup** through **Space Shooter 4 ‚Äì Rocks**.  
- Your **Game Over** sprite is imported and selected.  
- You know where to find the **Events**, **Looks**, and **Sound** blocks.  
</details>
:::

## Objective üßê

Display the Game Over screen, play a losing sound effect, and stop the entire game when the **Game Over** broadcast is received.

## Code Blocks üß±
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    hide
    go to [front v] layer

when I receive [Game Over v]
    show
    play sound [Lose v] until done
    stop [all v]
```
- The Game Over sprite is hidden at start and moved to the front so it overlays all other sprites.

- When the Game Over broadcast is received (from a Rock collision or timer end), the sprite appears, the "Lose" sound plays, and all scripts stop.
