## Code Blocks üß±
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    forever
        show
        if <touching [Dot v]?> then
            change [score v] by (3)
            wait (1) seconds
            hide
            wait (3) seconds
            show
        end
    end

when green flag clicked
    forever
        move (10) steps
        if on edge, bounce
    end
```
- The Crystal continuously shows and checks for collision with the Dot.

- On touch, it awards 3 points, hides for 1 second, then stays hidden for 3 more seconds before reappearing.

- Simultaneously, it drifts at 10 steps per frame and bounces off the stage edges.
