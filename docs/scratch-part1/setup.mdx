    <summary>**Prerequisites ‚Äì Before You Dive In!**</summary>

    Hey there, future developers! Before we launch into our Scratch games and machine-learning activities, make sure you‚Äôve got these essentials locked in:

    - [**Scratch Account**](https://scratch.mit.edu): Scratch is a free, online coding platform. No downloads required‚Äîjust snap blocks together to build games and animations.  
    - [**Scratch Documentation**](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Wiki_Home): Learn about sprites, backdrops, scripts, and how the Scratch editor is organized.  
    - **Google Account**: You‚Äôll need a free Google account to sign in to Teachable Machine.  
    - [**Teachable Machine**](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com): A browser-based tool from Google for training simple image or pose classification models‚Äîno code required.  

    With these ready, you‚Äôre all set for lift-off! üöÄ
