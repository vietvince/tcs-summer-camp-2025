    <summary>**Prerequisites: Before You Dive In!**</summary>

- You have completed **Setup**, **Star Chase 1 ‚Äì Importing Assets**, and **Star Chase 2 ‚Äì Dot**.  
- Your **Star** sprite is imported, hidden, and selected.  
- You know where to find the **Events**, **Motion**, **Control**, **Looks**, **Sound**, **Sensing**, and **Variables** blocks.  
</details>
:::

## Objective üßê

Make your **Star** sprite float around the screen, bounce off edges, and award points when collected by the Dot.

## Code Blocks üß±
```scratch
when green flag clicked
    show

when green flag clicked
    forever
        move (10) steps
        if on edge, bounce
    end

when green flag clicked
    forever
        if <touching [Dot v]?> then
            change [score v] by (1)
            play sound [collect v] until done
            hide
            wait (1) seconds
            show
        end
    end
```
- Show makes the Star appear at the start (it was hidden during setup).

- The first forever loop moves the Star 10 steps continuously and bounces it off the stage edges.

- The second forever loop checks for collisions with the Dot: when touched, it increases score by 1, plays the ‚Äúcollect‚Äù sound, hides for 1 second, then reappears.

- [x] Nice work! Your Stars are now collectible and award points. Up next: Star Chase 4 ‚Äì Crystal, where we‚Äôll add bonus items for extra points!
