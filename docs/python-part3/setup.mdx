## Prepare Your Creative Space

### Introduction to Google Colab

Google Colab, or Colaboratory, is an online platform that provides a Jupyter notebook environment for coding in Python. It is especially useful for data science, machine learning, and deep learning projects. Google Colab is powered by Google Cloud, allowing you to write and execute Python code in your browser with powerful computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, at no cost.

Think of this blank notebook as your creative space, just waiting for your ideas and code to bring it to life. You can write code, run it, and see the output all in one place.

### Setting Up Your Workspace

1. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your browser.

2. **Create a New Notebook**:
   - Click on the "File" menu and select "New notebook".

3. **Name Your Notebook**:
   - Click on the default name "Untitled" at the top of the notebook and rename it to something descriptive, like ‚ÄúYourLastName_ImageClassification‚Äù.

### Example Code Cell

Here's how you can start coding right away:

```python
# This is a code cell in Google Colab
print("Hello, World!")
```

To run the code, click the "Play" button on the left side of the cell or press `Shift + Enter` on your keyboard.
